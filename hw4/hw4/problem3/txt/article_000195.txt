The 34-year-old stars as a successful investment banker who has to rebuild his l
ife after his wife is killed in a car crash.
Directed by French-Canadian Jean-Marc Vallee, the tragicomedy also stars Naomi W
atts, Chris Cooper and newcomer Judah Lewis.
Almost 400 films will be screened at the festival over the next 11 days.
Introducing the world premiere of Demolition on stage, Vallee said his latest pr
oject was "probably the most rock 'n' roll film I've ever made".
"I think we can set the tone of this festival with the noise that we make tonigh
t," he said.
The director praised Gyllenhaal's performance in the film, saying: "There's noth
ing he hasn't done or tried.
"You'll see him dance, you'll see him sing - he went everywhere, surprising me a
ll the time."
Demolition brings Vallee back to TIFF for a third consecutive year, following Da
llas Buyers Club - which earned Matthew McConaughey an Oscar - and last year's W
ild, which saw Reese Witherspoon nominated for the best actress Academy award.
"You seem to love the films that I make - I want to come back again," Vallee jok
ed.
Also receiving its world premiere on Thursday was Michael Moore's first film in 
six years, Where to Invade Next.
A satire of US military power, the controversial director made the film in secre
t and it was not known he had made it until it was announced on TIFF's programme
.
Traditionally seen as the start of awards season - with film companies keen to k
ick-off their Oscar campaigns at the festival - TIFF will culminate with its own
 awards ceremony.
In past years, 12 Years a Slave, The King's Speech, Slumdog Millionaire and Amer
ican Beauty have won the top People's Choice Award before going on to win the be
st picture Oscar.
Last year's prize - which is voted for by the ticket-buying public - went to Ala
n Turing biopic The Imitation Game.
