(EW.com) -- This week's episode of "How I Met Your Mother" featured a pretty unf
orgettable smile-inducing kicker. After Ted found himself bemoaning his romantic
 setbacks and lack of personal progress, a look into the not-so-distant future r
evealed he had a daughter. Tear up? Join the club. But would you have guessed th
at the moment wasn't even part of the greater plan for the season? "We had a wee
k of treading water, to be honest," says co-creator/executive producer Carter Ba
ys. "We have the arc of the season going, but this was one week where there wasn
't one, specific big event happening. We always get nervous about those kinds of
 episodes because you want to know that the story is moving forward." So, he say
s, they took a "step back," and decided to put a little perspective on the overa
ll story of the series. "We were really telling the story that a father probably
 should tell his kids because it was only 22 minutes as opposed to seven seasons
," he jokes. Indeed the flashbacks and talk about the past was a nice reminder o
f where we've been with the gang. But as Bays sees it, it's also a great reminde
r of where we're going -- without giving everything away. Yes, he admits, they m
ade sure Neil Patrick Harris hid his left hand so we wouldn't know whether or no
t Barney would be married three years from now. "He's so good at making that loo
k natural," he says, laughing. "He's a magician; he's good with his hands. He kn
ows what he's doing" But does Barney? This episode saw the once notorious womani
zer seemingly settling into life as a one-woman man. To be fair, Becki Newton pr
eviously warned EW that Barney and Quinn would be on the fast track. But after j
ust a few episodes of courting, they're living together...and liking it! Is it a
ll too fast? Bays doesn't think so. "I think Barney is in love. At a certain age
, you stop worrying about the pacing so much and you sort of realize you're only
 on this planet a short time so you might as well be with the person you care ab
out the most," he says. "And I think that's Quinn right now for Barney." The bes
t way to show that, he says, was to break barriers -- by breaking wind. "We put 
off having a fart sound effect on our show for seven years, and we did pretty we
ll without it. And it was one of those things as a showrunner that you know two 
things right away: You're going to be embarrassed that you're doing it at the ta
ble read, and you know that in the final cut, it's going to be the funniest mome
nt and get a laugh," he says. "And it's not 'Blazing Saddles' -- cowboys sitting
 around eating beans â€” it's actually a very real threshold to cross in a 
relationship. It's a big relationship moment." So where do they go from here? Fo
r one, Quinn and Barney will continue moving pretty quickly, he says, and next w
eek, we'll see more from Robin (Colbie Smulders) than we did in this episode. "R
obin, there is some excitement in her life coming up, especially next week's epi
sode," he says. When we pick up, Robin and Ted still aren't talking and viewers 
are going to see how that affects their lives and friendship. "We went for the r
eality of those situations," he says. "I feel like on this show we've gone as fa
r as we can go where it's just the gang hanging out at the bar week in and week 
out, with these big thing happen to them that don't really change things. Ted an
d Robin have now reached the point where it's not as simple as hanging out at th
e bar and forgetting the fact that Ted's in love with her, and she's not in love
 with him. It's complicated." But, not to worry, he says. "I feel like [there's]
 a satisfying ending -- the way it all wraps up as the season comes to a close."
