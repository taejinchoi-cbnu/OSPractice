They say that pets become more and more like their owners as time goes by. So it
 should come as no surprise then that, like his master, Larry the Downing Street
 cat is himself fond of a little â€˜chillaxingâ€™ now and then. And on a day whe
n Britain basked in the hottest day of the year so far, with temperatures reachi
ng a sizzling 27c (81f), who could blame him. Taking it easy: Larry the Downing 
Street had more of a reputation for chillaxing outside on the pavement than catc
hing mice - until now . Stretched out in the Midday sun the brown and white tabb
y slumped down on his side and took a well-deserved cat nap just a few feet from
 the door of Number 10. Larry, a rescue cat from Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, w
as given the title of Chief Mouser to the Cabinet and was chosen by Downing Stre
et staff to tackle a growing rat problem last year. But since his arrival he app
ears to lack the killer instinct and instead of boasting an impressive kill rati
o Larry has become better known for his...sleeping. He may not have to worry abo
ut the eurozone crisis or hauling Britain out of recession, but that didn't stop
 Larry seemingly neglecting his rat catching duties when he soaked up the sun ye
sterday. Is David Cameron too 'chillaxed' to run the country? Is David Cameron t
oo 'chillaxed' to run the country? Now share your opinion . David Cameron attrac
ted some criticism for his own 'chillaxing' last week following claims in a biog
raphy that he spends weekends at Chequers singing karaoke, playing tennis agains
t a machine dubbed â€˜The Cleggerâ€™ and downing several glasses of wine with lu
nch. His latest afternoon snooze came as Britain baked. After the wettest April 
on record and perhaps the coldest start to May in 70 years the mercury is finall
y beginning to move in the right direction. Sunseekers poured onto the countryâ€
™s beaches whilst others headed into the garden for a spot of sunbathing. Creatu
re comforts: Larry, pictured last year, appears to enjoy a cat nap as much as an
y other feline . Those at the Chelsea Flower Show were left wilting whilst one m
an and his dinghy floated out to sea in South Devon sparking a major rescue oper
ation. Incredibly Britain was hotter than parts of Australia, South America, Afr
ica and the Middle East. It also left most of the Mediterranean in the shade. An
d the temperature is expected to rise even further today (thurs). Forecasters sa
id it could reach up to 28c (xxf) in the south and south east - and best of all,
 the glorious sunshine and blue skies are here to stay for at least a fortnight.
 Met Office forecaster Helen Chivers said: â€˜It is bikini and ice cream weather
 for almost the whole country. Distracted: The preoccupied Prime Minister attrac
ted criticism for his supposed 'chillaxing' style when pictured watching the end
 of the Champions League final . Running talks: Earlier in this week's G8 summit
 talks at Camp David, Mr Cameron and President Obama staged a 35-minute 'treadmi
ll summit' side by side at the gym . â€˜Pretty much everywhere has temperatures 
in the 20s Celsius and wall-to-wall sunshine. â€˜In recent weeks we had low pres
sure over or close to the UK, bringing rain and cold temperatures. â€˜Over the l
ast couple of days, that has given way to high pressure, sunny weather and risin
g temperatures from the Continent.â€™ At 26.9c (80.4f) yesterday (wed) was the h
ottest day of the year, but it is expected to get even hotter today (thurs). It 
will be 28c and sunny in London. Summer sun: Larry's sunbathing session came as 
the rest of the UK enjoyed a gloriously hot May, including here in Aviemore, Sco
tland, where temperatures reached 26.9C . Basking: Rhianna Mallia, 18, and Louis
e Dougherty, 21, were just two of the many people who enjoyed the sun in Aviemor
e, which posted the hottest temperatures of the year in the UK yesterday . Bizar
rely, the highest temperature was not recorded in the south but in the Scottish 
ski resort of Aviemore. It also hit 26.9c (80.4f) at Londonâ€™s Heathrow Airport
, 25.9c (78.6f) on Bournemouthâ€™s beaches and 25.6c (78.1f) in Londonâ€™s St Ja
mesâ€™s Park. Supermarkets reported a surge in sales of sausages, burgers and su
mmer tipple Pimms as well as picnic treats such as pork pies. Five million sausa
ges - 70 per cent more than normal - are expected to fly off supermarket shelves
 over the weekend as the country makes the most of the mini heatwave. Not the on
ly one: Larry the cat was one of many who decided to kick back yesterday, includ
ing angler Arthur Cansfield in the Lake District . Asda also predicts it will se
ll one million burgers, half a million bags of salad - 20 per cent more than in 
a normal week - as well as a 115 per cent increase in burger bun sales. Chris Ca
rden, Asdaâ€™s head of fresh food supply, said: â€˜We have already seen rising s
ales throughout the week of typical BBQ fare such as burgers and sausages but wi
th the mini heatwave expected to continue into the weekend, weâ€™re expecting it
 to be one of the biggest weâ€™ve ever seen for barbecue foods.â€™ Only days ago
 the country endured temperatures up to 4c colder than the average for this time
 of year. Ironically, the sweltering weather comes amid a relaxation of the hose
pipe ban which was imposed by seven water companies on April 5 after months of d
rought only for it to rain almost non-stop for the rest of the month. Meanwhile,
 the arrival of the sun saw betting firm Ladbrokes slash the odds of the tempera
ture soaring past 39c (103f) during the Jubilee weekend from 20/1 to just 8/1. J
essica Bridge of Ladbrokes said: â€˜It finally looks like summer has arrived, an
d the odds suggest the Jubilee weekend could be a scorcher.â€™
