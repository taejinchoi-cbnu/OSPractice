e is 7 years old and weighs just 45 pounds. But over the course of four months, 
a medical clinic being paid with state dollars prescribed her a cocktail of anti
-psychotic drugs that her family doctor says could be dangerous even for an adul
t. The drugs didn't fix her temper tantrums and bad moods. Instead, they made he
r problems worse. And when she tried to go off of them, she became almost uncont
rollable. Brooke is just one of millions of foster children across the country w
ho have been prescribed unprecedented levels of powerful mind-altering drugs in 
an often misguided attempt to control the emotional problems these kids experien
ce after watching their families break apart. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . No solutio
n: The heavy doses of dangerous drugs didn't make Brooke's problems better... th
ey made them worse . ABC News reports that foster kids are 13 times more likely 
to receive 'mind-altering' psychotropic drugs than other children. Taxpayer-fund
ed clinics have even prescribed the drugs, which are often approved only for adu
lt use, to infants. Brooke was already facing an uphill battle to having a healt
hy childhood. Her mother was a drug dealer and a prostitute. Brooke was placed i
n a foster home at an early age, removed from her broken family and given to the
 care of strangers. The freckle-faced redhead counted 10 drugs that she was pres
cribed to control her temper tantrums and bad moods. But they didn't help, so do
ctors at the clinic in Florida continued increasing her doses. When foster mom L
isa Ward objected to the heavy medication, she was told that if she didn't follo
w the instructions of the state-sponsored doctors, Brooke could be taken away fr
om her and placed with another foster family. Happy endings: After Brooke got of
f the medications, things turned better for her. Her foster mother adopted her a
nd she's learning to deal with her problems . Finally Ms Ward paid to send Brook
e to a private doctor. What he saw horrified him: 'The first thing we've got to 
think about, "Is the medicine causing this?"' asked psychiatrist Dr Luis Quinone
s. But now, after a painful process of weening herself off the drugs, Brooke is 
better. Ms Ward and her husband adopted the 7-year-old and she has a new solutio
n her her problems. 'What's another choice over a tantrum? What's a good choice?
' Ms Ward recently asked her adopted daughter. 'To hug you,' Brooke replied. The
 problem has reached the ears of legislators in Washington, who heard testimony 
from some of foster children affected by this trend. Ke'onte, 12, tells Congress
 that he was wrongly diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADHD and given four dif
ferent medications that left him in a 'stupor' A 12-year-old boy bravely told ho
w he was medicated into a near-stupor as he was passed between foster care homes
. The seventh grader, known only as Ke'onte, told Congress that being given the 
mind-altering drugs was 'the worst thing anyone could do to foster kids'. He rev
ealed that he could barely eat while on the medication and was so exhausted 'it 
felt like I would collapse wherever I was in the house'. 'I think putting me on 
all these stupid meds was the stupidest thing Iâ€™ve ever experienced in foster 
care,' he said. Medicated: The Government study found children in foster care we
re 13 times more likely to be on anti-pyschotics and anti-depressants than other
 children . Ke'onte's plight came to light as a Government Accountability Office
 report was released that found the federal government had not done enough to ov
ersee the treatment of foster children with powerful drugs. The study found care
d-for children were up to 13 times more likely to be prescribed anti-psychotics 
and anti-depressants than other children. Ke'onte, who was adopted in 2009, said
 he had tantrums as a foster child and was inaccurately diagnosed as bipolar and
 having ADHD. 'Iâ€™ve been in the mental hospital three times during foster care
, and every time I had to get on more meds or new meds to add to the ones I was 
already taking,' he said. He was on four different types of medication during hi
s four years in six foster care and the drugs made him feel irritable, gave him 
stomach aches and affected his appetite, reports ABC. 'I remember having a bowl 
of spaghetti and had three bites and then I was done,' he said. He has since bee
n taken off the medication and given therapy, and is thriving. He plays clarinet
 in the school band, competes in cross-country and has had roles in the school p
lay. He said: 'In therapy, you talk about the deepest thing and it hurts, but yo
u can deal with it better the next time. 'Iâ€™m not only more focused in schoolâ
€¦ Iâ€™m not going to the office anymore for bad behavior and Iâ€™m happy.' vide
