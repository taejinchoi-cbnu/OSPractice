EST, 20 March 2013 . investigations: The French Foreign office is investigating 
reports that geologist Philippe Verdon was beheaded by terror group Al-Qaeda in 
the Islamic Maghreb on March 10 . Al Qaeda terrorists today claimed to have behe
aded a French hostage in retaliation for his countryâ€™s war in Mali. Foreign Of
fice officials in Paris said they were trying to verify reports of the horrific 
death of Philippe Verdon, who has been in captivity for the past 14 months. Al-Q
aeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which is waging a terrorist campaign against
 the French Army in Mali, claims it cut the geologistâ€™s head off on March 10 â
€˜in response to Franceâ€™s intervention in Northern Mali.â€™ Referring to Franc
ois Hollande, a spokesman for the group calling himself Al-Qairawani added: â€˜T
he French President Hollande is responsible for the lives of the other French ho
stages.â€™ There are at least 14 French hostages currently held by Al Qaeda in w
est Africa, including seven by AQIM. It means that France, which has already los
t five soldiers fighting in Mali since the war started in January, is slowly bei
ng sucked into an increasingly bloody terrorist war. Mr Hollande sent a force in
to Mali specifically to prevent the north of the country from being used as a la
unch pad for terror attacks in Africa and in the West. Mr Verdon, who is in his 
50s, was captured on November 24 2011 along with Serge Lazarevic, a colleague. T
he men, who were on a business trip, were kidnapped from their hotel in Hombori,
 in the north of Mali. AQIM claimed that both men were secret agents or mercenar
ies, and later released a video of Mr Verdon in captivity. The hostagesâ€™ famil
ies have expressed growing fears about the menâ€™s safety, especially following 
the invasion of Mali. On Monday, Mr Verdonâ€™s father . Jean-Pierre Verdon said:
 â€˜We are in a total fog and it is impossible to . live this way. We have no in
formation.â€™ Captured: Mr Verdon has been held captive for 14 months, having be
en captured on November 24 2011 along with colleague Serge Lazarevic . No inform
ation: On Monday, Mr VerdonÂ¿s father Jean-Pierre Verdon said: Â¿We are in a tot
al fog and it is impossible to live this way. We have no informationÂ¿ . The Ver
don family were particularly concerned by Mr Hollandeâ€™s firm announcement that
 France would not pay ransoms. French forces arrived in Mali on January 11 to he
lp the Malian Army against Al-Qaeda fighters who had controlled the north of the
 country since April 2012. France now has more than 4,000 troops on the ground i
n Mali, most carrying out clean-up operations after driving out most of the Isla
mist rebels from the area. Senior Al-Qaeda commanders Mokhtar Belmokhtar and Abd
elhamid Abou Zeid are believed to have been killed in Mali earlier this month. A
 rescue operation ordered by Mr Hollande to free a French secret agent held host
age in Somalia since mid-2009 ended in failure in January after he was killed al
ong with two French soldiers.
