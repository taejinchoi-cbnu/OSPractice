FA head of security Tony Conniford admitted that the association is 'freaking ou
t over safety in Rio' FA head of security Tony Conniford said senior figures in 
the England set-up were â€˜freaking outâ€™ over reports of crime and violence fr
om Rioâ€™s gang-ridden shanty towns, or favelas, the largest of which,Â  Rocinha
, is near Englandâ€™s hotel. He also raised the astonishing prospect that Englan
d stars such as Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard could be stuck on the team bus f
or up to four hours in gridlocked traffic as they travel nine miles to and from 
their training base. While officially the FA say they are â€˜fully confidentâ€™ 
in security arrangements, former policeman Mr Connifordâ€™s comments, overheard 
by a Mail on Sunday reporter in the bar of the England hotel in Rio, raise quest
ions about preparations. Mr Connifordâ€™s assessment was delivered in a loud voi
ce to a Brazilian colleague. A reporter from this newspaper was having a meal at
 a nearby table and was able to take notes. Mr Conniford, a 30-year veteran of E
ssex Police, told the Brazilian, an ex-military officer: â€˜The problems here ha
ve been all over the papers. Itâ€™s bad. I get calls from management, from my bo
sses at the FA, freaking out saying, â€œTony, are you sure itâ€™s safe?â€ â€˜Th
ey ask me, â€œIs this really going to be safe for the team?â€ They are worried.
 These are real concerns. â€˜We have to be extra vigilant. We cannot afford to m
ake any mistakes. Security must be paramount.â€™ Mr Connifordâ€™s comments â€“ c
oming just a month before the tournament kicks off â€“ raise serious question ma
rks over the FAâ€™s decision to base themselves in central Rio. Englandâ€™s hote
l, the ageing Royal Tulip, is rated by travel website TripAdvisor as only the 93
rd best in the city. Only one other team â€“ Holland, who will train much closer
 to their hotel â€“ are based in the city, while Germany have built their own pr
ivate beach resort to stay in. England's hotel is located within view of the Roc
inha favela in Rio where armed gangs are being targeted by police . Mr Conniford
 told his colleague that a nine-mile trip between the squadâ€™s training base in
 a military camp at Sao Joao Fort in Urca in the shadow of Sugarloaf mountain an
d the hotel had taken him two hours. He said: â€˜The traffic is awful. Even with
 a police escort it will be a nightmare. The roads are terrible. The traffic is 
my biggest worry. This is a logistical nightmare. We have to work on how we get 
the team from A to B without getting held up. â€˜We will be stuck in traffic the
 whole time.â€™ The airport, where the England players and their retinue, totall
ing no fewer than 78 people, will have to travel to to get to their group games,
 is even further away. Mr Conniford said he also had concerns about security wit
hin the Urca military base when England were training. He told the Brazilian: â€
˜Your guys need to know they can challenge anyone to see their badges. They must
 check and re-check everyone.â€™ And on hotel security, he said: â€˜We canâ€™t a
fford to let anyone in because once you are through that door out there you can 
go straight to the lift and get straight up to the playersâ€™ rooms in no time.â
€™ As more than 50,000 England fans prepare to descend on Brazil, it is hard to 
imagine they have much idea of what actually awaits them: . Heavily armed sniper
s have been tasked to patrol the Rocinha favela, near where the England team wil
l be based for the World Cup . Brazilian authorities are having difficulties cla
mping down violence in advance of the World Cup . The host cities for Englandâ€™
s first games â€“ Manaus, Sao Paolo and Belo Horizonte â€“ are plagued by robber
ies, murders and muggings. Sao Paolo has its own slum problem and, in Manaus, a 
steaming jungle city a four-hour flight north of Rio, child â€˜gangsâ€™ roam the
 streets robbing visitors at knifepoint. The violence shows no sign of abating. 
One person was shot dead on Friday as Rio police clashed with armed men in a fav
ela close to the England hotel. Over the past six years the Rio authorities have
 established 39 so-called police pacification units, or UPPs, in the favelas in 
an attempt to smash drug and street gangs. England captain Steven Gerrard  and h
is team will be based within view of Rio's biggest slum as they prepare for thei
r three World Cup group matches . More than 50,000 England fans are expected to 
travel to the tournament where there have been regular violent protests . Adrian
 Bevington, Managing Director of Club England, said: â€˜The FA are confident in 
the security arrangements in place. Tony is a vastly experienced officer and was
 simply overheard doing his job. He has our full support.â€™ Tory MP Chris Heato
n-Harris, who is a qualified referee and member of the All-Party Parliamentary F
ootball Group, said last night: â€˜Like every English fan, I want our team and i
ts management to be as safe as possible and would expect these concerns to have 
been addressed by now.â€™ An FA source said that Mr Conniford was using the oppo
rtunity to emphasise to Brazilian authorities that their extra support is apprec
iated and the conversation was private.
