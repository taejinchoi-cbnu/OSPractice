It carries out a monthly survey of firms that tracks indicators such as new orde
rs, employment and exports.
The latest report for April suggested a modest deterioration in business conditi
ons, as output and new orders declined following growth in March.
That was the fourth monthly decline in activity in the last five months.
Ulster Bank's chief economist, Richard Ramsey, said Northern Ireland's modest de
cline in private sector activity compares with growth in all of the other UK reg
ions.
Manufacturing continued to be a bright spot, with output growth and new orders r
ebounding to a 6-month high, driven by market demand in Great Britain.
By contrast, Northern Ireland retailers reported their sharpest decline in retai
l sales since May 2012 and the construction sector posted its largest fall in bu
siness activity in two years.
Mr Ramsey said that despite the apparent weakness suggested by the results, comp
anies are continuing to hire staff.
"Despite uncertainty and lack of demand, local firms saw their staffing levels r
ise in April at the fastest rate in seven months. Employment growth was reported
 across all sectors with the exception of construction," he added.
Looking forward, he said that the detail of the new Conservative government's fi
scal plans and economic policies "will affect all sectors of the economy both pu
blic and private".
