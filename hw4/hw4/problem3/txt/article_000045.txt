father had just died. She couldn't breathe and she was having a fit, even though
 she was on oxygen,' said Giuliana DiGeronimo, the couple's daughter. 'At the n
ursing home, everyone said they were angels. Everybody used to say how much they
 loved each other and how my father was always trying to help my mother.' The co

 Family members say Livia died of a 'broken heart' 'I told her she needed to be 
strong and that my dad had passed away. She started screaming his name and didn'
t want to talk and hung up the phone,' Munzenmaier said. Soon after, her brother
 got the call that their mother too had passed. 'They yelled and screamed at eac
h other almost every day, but I think it was because they liked making up so muc
h,' Munzenmaier said. 'My mom was feisty. She wouldn't let my father get away wi
th anything,'
