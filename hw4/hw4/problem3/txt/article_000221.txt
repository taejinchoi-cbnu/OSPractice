The billionaire and reality TV star said Mr McCain was only considered a hero be
cause he was a prisoner of war.
He then added: "I like people who weren't captured."
The comments prompted strong criticism across the party. Rival contender Rick Pe
rry said the remarks were a "new low" in US politics.
Mr Trump later sought to clarify his remarks, although he did not apologise.
"If a person is captured, they're a hero as far as I'm concerned," he said. "I d
on't like the job John McCain is doing in the Senate because he is not taking ca
re of our veterans.''
The two have clashed before, with Mr McCain accusing Mr Trump of having "fired u
p the crazies" with his attacks on Mexican immigrants.
Mr McCain was held for five-and-a-half years after his plane was shot down in th
e Vietnam war. Mr Trump avoided service through student and medical deferments.
The 2008 presidential candidate is yet to respond to Mr Trump's remarks, althoug
h his daughter Meghan tweeted she was "disgusted".
Many of Mr Trump's rivals for the nomination lined up to attack him.
There are currently 15 people running to be the Republican presidential candidat
e.
Mr Trump has led in some early polls, although analysts have predicted his appea
l is likely to wane as the contest develops.
