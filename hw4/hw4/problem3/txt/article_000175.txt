EST, 10 December 2013 . Close: Dennis Langsford, with his daughter Ruth, had Alz
heimer's for 17 years of his life . When we canâ€™t put a name to a familiar fac
e, or we lose our keys, most of us will see it as nothing more than a minor irri
tation. But for Ruth Langsford, seemingly trivial moments of forgetfulness bear 
a sinister warning of the illness that killed her beloved father. After watching
 Dennis Langsford battle Alzheimerâ€™s for 17 years before his death aged 85 in 
February last year, she is terrified of following in his footsteps. The ITV1 Thi
s Morning host has described how the pain of watching her father â€˜lose his ide
ntityâ€™ to dementia was too much to bear â€“ and she would be devastated if the
 same thing happened to her or her husband, Sky News reader Eamonn Holmes. The 5
3-year-old has spoken of her fears for the first time to help raise awareness of
 the Alzheimerâ€™s Societyâ€™s helpline, which will be under pressure from incre
ased demand during the festive season. She said: â€˜I saw the detrition of my fa
ther and it is something which worries me. I worry that I have dementia in the f
amily and one day I may get it. â€˜I mean, every time you mislay your car keys o
r struggle to remember somebodyâ€™s name, you think, â€œOh my God, here we goâ€
. Me, my mum and my sister joke about it but obviously it is in the back of our 
minds and it is a worry. Deep down there is always that fear. â€˜I think the thi
ng I fear most about dementia is losing my dignity and people not understanding 
you. â€˜I hope it never happens to me and . Eamonn. When I saw my parents, they 
had been married many years, and mum . started to believe he didnâ€™t recognise 
her. Love: Ruth and her husband Eamonn Holmes have an 11-year-old son called Jac
k . â€˜It absolutely broke my heart to see that and I would hope it never happen
s to us for that reason alone.â€™ However, Miss Langsford said she still doesnâ€
™t believe in using technology to find out if sheâ€™s at risk of developing the 
disease. â€˜I believe there are blood tests that you can undergo to find out if 
you are going to get it but I donâ€™t think I would want to know,â€™ said Miss L
angsford, who has an 11-year-old son called Jack with Holmes, 54. â€˜Because I k
now the illness canâ€™t be cured, I know there is no happy ending and why would 
you want to know when there is no preventative? It isnâ€™t like there is someone
 to say if you drink this syrup every day then you wonâ€™t get Alzheimerâ€™s, so
 I donâ€™t see the point in being told now. Fear: Ruth, who hosts This Morning w
ith her husband, says she doesn't want to know what lies ahead . â€˜I know what 
my life would be, and it is enough to have seen someone go through it than to be
 burdened with the knowledge it is going to happen to you too.â€™ The Alzheimerâ
€™s Societyâ€™s national dementia helpline receives 38,000 calls annually, with 
a higher volume during Christmas when families are reunited. Miss Langsford is a
lso helping the Dementia Friends campaign, which provides support to carers and 
the families of sufferers. The scheme helps to teach patientsâ€™ loved-ones how 
to communicate with them and explains the effects of the illness. For confidenti
al advice, information and support, call Alzheimer's Society's National Dementia
