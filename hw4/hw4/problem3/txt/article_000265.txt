The boss of HSBC was last night facing questions over his secretive tax affairs 
after claiming he sheltered money in a Swiss bank account to prevent prying coll
eagues from finding out his bonus. Speaking publicly for the first time since re
velations about HSBCâ€™s Swiss private bank, Stuart Gulliver described his â€˜sh
ameâ€™ at allegations that the lender routinely helped clients including arms de
alers and blood diamond smugglers evade taxes. But he was also forced to defend 
his own finances after leaked documents revealed he sheltered some Â£5million in
 bonuses in an HSBC account in Switzerland under the name of a Panamanian compan
y. Leaked files reportedly show that Stuart Gulliver (pictured), chief executive
 since 2011, held Â£5million in the bank's Geneva-based subsidiary that was at t
he centre of a huge tax avoidance scandal . This lasted from 1998 until 2011, wh
en he became chief executive and his pay details had to be published anyway. Las
t night one accountant described the complex arrangement in Switzerland as a â€˜
classic case of tax avoidanceâ€™. The HSBC boss was also facing questions after 
revealing that he is domiciled in Hong Kong for tax purposes despite being born 
in Derby and living in the UK. Mr Gulliver, 55, said the computer systems on the
 trading floor enabled staff to find out how much their colleagues were being pa
id in bonuses. As he was often the best paid employee at the bank, he said he wa
s particularly keen to stop this happening and set up a Swiss bank account to ke
ep his pay secret. Mr Gulliver added that he used the Panama structure purely to
 prevent colleagues in Switzerland finding how much he was being paid. The revel
ation comes after leaked documents from HSBC Private Bank in Switzerland (pictur
ed) between 2005 and 2007 showed it had helped the rich and famous avoid million
s in tax . He said there was â€˜no tax advantageâ€™ and declared that he has pai
d full UK tax on his earnings since moving from Hong Kong to London with HSBC in
 2003. Springing to his defence, the bankâ€™s chairman, Douglas Flint, said: â€˜
There is absolutely no story here. There is nothing that Stuart has done that is
 not absolutely transparent, legal and appropriate.â€™ Seeking to justify his ta
x status, Mr Gulliver said he had spent the majority of his 35-year career at HS
BC in Hong Kong and plans to return there when he steps down from the bank. Busi
nesses are expected to behave better than the armed forces and the church, HSBCâ
€™s chief executive complained yesterday. Expressing his exasperation with regul
ators, Stuart Gulliver said: â€˜We seem now to be holding publicly listed compan
ies to a different standard than we might hold the armed forces, the church or a
ny large organisation. â€˜It seems to be a notion that Douglas [HSBC chairman Do
uglas Flint] and I should know what every single one of our 257,000 staff is doi
ng all day long. That isnâ€™t normally how large organisations can run.â€™ HSBC 
has been criticised as being â€˜too big to manageâ€™ after a series of scandals 
flared up on Mr Gulliverâ€™s watch. It was fined Â£1.2billion by US regulators i
n 2012 after lax controls meant it became the â€˜bank of choiceâ€™ for Mexican d
rug cartels wanting to launder money. It was also fined Â£400million by UK and U
S authorities last November for rigging the Â£3.5trillion a day foreign exchange
 market. David Buik from broker Panmure Gordon said: â€˜Mr Gulliver may be right
 that companies are being held to higher standards. But to complain about it doe
s sound a bit rich given the litany of misdemeanours at banks. They have brought
 it on themselves.â€™ â€˜I would expect to die abroad,â€™ he added. But the comm
ents received short shrift last night. Richard Murphy, a tax accountant, said he
 was â€˜astonishedâ€™ that HM Revenue & Customs has allowed Mr Gulliver to remai
n domiciled in Hong Kong despite the fact that he has lived in the UK for the pa
st 12 years. â€˜Being paid in a Swiss bank account via a company is a classic ca
se of tax avoidance,â€™ he said. â€˜But the big question is how on earth a man c
an leave the UK at the age of 21, come back 12 years ago and remain permanently 
domiciled in Hong Kong. I am astonished this has been accepted by the HMRC. â€˜T
here are clearly advantages to this arrangement. Among other things it allows Mr
 Gulliver to avoid inheritance tax.â€™ Although there is no suggestion that Mr G
ulliver has done anything illegal, the spotlight on his personal finances comes 
as HSBC is under scrutiny over allegations that its private Swiss bank helped cl
ients evade taxes. Yesterday Mr Gulliver said the wrongdoing was a â€˜source of 
shame and reputational damage to HSBCâ€™. Despite this he received a Â£7.6millio
n pay package last year, including a Â£1.3million bonus. This was a drop from hi
s Â£8million package in 2013 â€“ his bonus was cut by Â£500,000 to reflect other
 wrongdoing at the bank. HSBC said its profits fell by 17 per cent last year to 
Â£12.2billion, while the bonus pool was cut from Â£2.6billion to Â£2.4billion.
