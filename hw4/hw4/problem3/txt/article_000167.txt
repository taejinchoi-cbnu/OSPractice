The report by the High Fliers market research company found that about 1,000 gra
duates turned down job offers at the last minute, leaving employers searching fo
r replacements in 2015.
Around 20,000 students were recruited, mostly at the start of their last year.
This means students have time to change their plans if better options emerge.
Martin Birchall, High Fliers managing director, said: "At the very top end of th
e market, employers are fighting it out over the same few candidates - those who
 are expected to do well, with the best CVs and who have developed their skills 
at university.
"It's not unusual for the top employers to tell us that more and more of these g
raduates are receiving five or six offers."
He added: "It's very welcome news that Britain's top employers are recruiting th
eir biggest-ever intake of new graduates in 2016.
"But as the job market goes from strength to strength, it's clear that our brigh
test graduates are becoming increasingly choosy about the employers they join."
The number of graduates hired rose 3.3% in 2015 with their starting salary at th
e UK's leading employers remaining at about Â£30,000 for the second year runni
ng.
However, graduate pay at the top law firms, investment banks and accounting firm
s increased further.
