Itâ€™s been nearly three months since a photograph of Kathy Griffin posing with 
a replica of President Donald Trumpâ€˜s bloodied, decapitated head in her hand s
parked nationwide outrage â€” and changed her life forever. 
  
 In an in-depth interview with New York magazineâ€™s The Cut, the comedian â€” w
ho, in the wake of the scandal, was fired from the CNN New Yearâ€™s Eve broadcas
t that she had co-hosted with Anderson Cooper for 10 years â€” discussed the con
troversial photo at length, revealing that it was the catalyst that ultimately e
nded her nearly two decade-long friendship with Cooper. 
  
 When the photo surfaced on May 30, the CNN anchor took to Twitter to condemn it
: â€œFor the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in
,â€ he wrote. â€œIt is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.â€

 According to Griffin, in the following days, four of Cooperâ€™s CNN colleagues 
reached out repeatedly to check on her and offer private support. Cooper, howeve
r, didnâ€™t contact Griffin until Aug. 10, The Cut confirmed with CNN. 
  
 On July 26, when asked about his relationship with Griffin on Watch What Happen
s Live with Andy Cohen, Cooper said that the two were still friends.

 â€œYeah, weâ€™re still friends,â€ he said. â€œAnd look, I said what I said abo
ut â€” I didnâ€™t think what she said was appropriate, but I wish her the best a
nd I hope she bounces back. Sheâ€™s incredibly funny and a lot of people love he
r and I think sheâ€™ll bounce back from this.â€ 
  
 Cooper had previously made similar statements during an appearance at Arizonaâ€
™s Comerica Theatre on June 11: â€œI donâ€™t want anybodyâ€™s career to be destr
oyed because they do something unfortunate and inappropriate,â€ he said at the 
time. â€œLook, I wish her well and I hope she bounces back and keeps doing what 
she does best, which is make people laugh.â€ 
  
 â€œCNN made the decision not to bring her back,â€ he added. â€œI had nothing t
o do with it, but I certainly understand why they made that decision.â€ 
  
 Griffin, 56, told the magazine that the fact that Cooper was publicly claiming 
they were friends while not checking in with her hurt deeply. When he finally re
ached out to her in a series of text messages, she told him their friendship was
 over. 
  
 A source close to Cooper, 50, told the magazine that Cooper was â€œshocked and 
upset by the photo, and while he was not ready to talk to her personally about i
t, he still considered her to be a friend, and was publicly supportive when aske
d about the controversy.â€

 According to Griffin, other celebrities were more solicitous in the aftermath, 
such as Jerry Seinfeld and Jamie Foxx, who both spoke publicly in support of the
 comedian. According to Griffin, Amy Schumer personally sent her a funny video a
nd former Today show host Billy Bush â€” who was notoriously caught up in his ow
n Trump-related scandal â€” reportedly suggested in a note that Griffin stay qui
et for a while and take up meditation. 
  
 Despite the far-reaching consequences of the photo, Griffin told The Cut sheâ€™
s tired of apologizing for it.

 â€œWhy are people still expecting me to apologize and grovel to a man that twee

 â€œPresident Trump just pardoned Joe Arpaio, who was essentially running a conc
entration camp in the Arizona desert,â€ she later added. â€œHe said there are s

 Kathy Griffin walked into her home office just before noon in late June, still 
wearing pajamas. The comedian, who regularly stays up late, had just woken up to
 news of President Trumpâ€™s latest Twitter tear. Trump had covered a wide range
 of topics in a series of tweets, from denouncing Robert Muellerâ€™s investigati
on into Russian interference in the election to House Democratic leader Nancy Pe
losi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer â€” or, as Trump called him in a
 tweet that morning, â€œCryinâ€™ Chuck.â€ 
  
 â€œWhy are people still expecting me to apologize and grovel to a man that twee
ts like this?â€ Griffin vented to me. â€œIâ€™m a comedian; heâ€™s our fucking p
resident.â€ 
  
 It had been 23 days since a photograph of Griffin holding a Donald Trump mask c
overed in fake blood completely altered her life. Cooked up as satire in a singl
e afternoon, it first appeared on TMZ and then spread across social media rapidl
y, uniting Republicans and Democrats in outrage. Griffin released a video apolog
y almost immediately after the photoâ€™s release, but the damage was done; the n
ext day, Trump intensified the backlash by tweeting a claim that his son Barron,
 11, was having a difficult time dealing with the image. And members of the Firs
t Family, including Trumpâ€™s two older sons, launched an aggressive public camp
aign against Griffin. 
  
 In the following days, the Secret Service opened an investigation; Griffin was 
fired from the CNN New Yearâ€™s Eve broadcast that she had co-hosted with Anders
on Cooper for ten years; a lucrative endorsement contract was canceled, and so w
ere 15 scheduled live performances, owing to bomb threats, which she estimates c
ost her more than a million dollars. Thousands of death threats rolled in, some 
of her close friends abandoned her, and even her beloved Fox Newsâ€“loving mothe
r, Maggie Griffin, joked to her daughter that she would not have her support. 
  
 A carefully choreographed apology tour might have helped Griffin move past the 
controversy â€” the video she filmed the day the photo was released felt hasty, 
and a defensive press conference a few days later was widely criticized after Gr
iffin (who had, after all, fired the first salvo against Trump) presented hersel
f as a victim. But moving on doesnâ€™t seem to be on Griffinâ€™s mind: The short
 promotional video she just released for her new Laugh Your Head Off tour of Eur
ope, Australia, and New Zealand concludes with an image of her in the same blous
e she wore in the infamous Trump photo, holding a globe in her hand instead of a
 Trump mask. And sheâ€™s still angry with the president. 
  
 â€œPresident Trump just pardoned Joe Arpaio, who was essentially running a conc
entration camp in the Arizona desert,â€ she tells me over the phone this past w
eekend. â€œHe said there are some good Nazis, and heâ€™s kicking out young adult
s who were brought here as kids by their parents, and Iâ€™m the one who has to c
ontinue to apologize?â€ 
  
 Between these two conversations, I visited Griffin at her home in Los Angeles a
 number of times (we first met a dozen years ago at a party; in the last year, a
fter she reached out to me via Twitter DM, we began discussing politics regularl
y). She paid $10.5 million last year for a 13,000-square-foot mansion with all t
he trappings; her next-door neighbors are Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. â€œIâ€™
ve moved in next door to my act!â€ she tells me. (She says theyâ€™re excellent 
neighbors and donâ€™t make any noise. When I was with Griffin, Kardashian sent h
er a text message to see how she was feeling.) 
  
 Griffin, who made her career by mocking celebrities, is not the most likely com
edian to be martyred over the inalienable right to criticize the president. But 
in the past couple of years, her act has become more and more political. She say
s that has led some of her fans to bristle. â€œComedians talk about what their a
udience is faced with every day, we try to relate to our audience,â€ she says. 
â€œIâ€™m obsessed with politics. I always have been, and now, with Trump, many p
eople are obsessed with politics, so thatâ€™s going to be a big part of my act.â
€ 
  
 In the course of our talks, the theme she returned to most forcefully was the r
ight to provoke with humor. Griffin describes a visit to an LGBT center in Los A
ngeles, during which an AIDS patient asked her to mock him so he could feel norm
al, as a defining moment in her career, and an example of the value of seemingly
 outrageous comedy. â€œI would be abandoning my principles as a comic and a huma
n being if I backed off President Trump or any public person,â€ she tells me. â
€œComics by their nature are anti-Establishment. They are charged with the often
 unenviable task of going after people in power. I will never abdicate that resp
onsibility.â€ 
  
 Griffin fears the impact of what happened to her will resonate further. â€œWhen
 the president tweeted about me the morning after I released the image, it serve
d as an executive order of sorts to his family and supporters to go after me,â€
 she says. â€œYou may say I deserved it, but just think about it â€¦ the preside
nt of the United States and his family are going after a stand-up comic who had 
a show on the Bravo network called My Life on the D-List. If that isnâ€™t punchi
ng down, I donâ€™t know what is.â€ 
  
 Griffin says she isnâ€™t a victim: â€œI am in a position of privilege, I will b
e fine,â€ she says. â€œBut what about any American citizen, whether theyâ€™re a
rtists or not, who innocently post a shocking photo on social media â€” will the
y face a federal investigation?â€ Griffin also worries about the â€œchilling ef
fectâ€ created by the retribution wielded by a vengeful president and his army 
of supporters. She thinks that just as sheâ€™s taken responsibility for her prov
ocative image, Trump â€œhas to take responsibility for the power he holds with h
is Twitter account.â€ 
  
 Even if one agrees with Griffinâ€™s sentiments, itâ€™s fair to wonder what the 
image of Trumpâ€™s severed head signified beyond the obvious interpretation, and
 whether Griffin should have realized how much blowback it would create, given t
he hyperpolarized media environment that surrounds the president. 
  
 Rick Wilson, a longtime Republican political consultant who denounced Trump ear
ly and hasnâ€™t wavered since, says he found Griffinâ€™s image â€œway outside th
e boundaries and unhelpful against the cause. I understand how strong passions a
gainst Trump run, mine do very frequently, but people are always looking for rea
sons to delegitimize you.â€ Charlie Sykes, a conservative political commentator
 and former radio host who is famously anti-Trump, tells me that Griffin gave Tr
ump and his supporters a big gift by releasing the image. â€œThe moment I saw th
e picture, I knew [the outcry from Trump and his supporters] was going to happen
. Itâ€™s a useful meme for Trump: Itâ€™s the left that incites violence, itâ€™s 
the left that engages in hate.â€

 The photos were improvised in an afternoon: Tyler Shields, a celebrity photogra
pher known for his provocative images (he once shot an image of a black man hang
ing a member of the KKK), was taking some updated portraits of Griffin, and afte
rward, they decided to create some spoof images involving Trump. Griffin dispatc
hed her assistant to find a Trump mask and a friend made fake blood using ketchu
p. They wanted to comment on Trumpâ€™s infamous comments about Megyn Kelly â€” â
€œblood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her whereverâ€ â€” after sh
e questioned him about his history of sexist comments in the first Republican pr
esidential debate in 2015. 
  
 With Griffinâ€™s permission, Shields (who did not respond to requests for comme
nt) released the image â€” although he didnâ€™t tell her where it would go first
. Shields, according to Griffin, chose to give it to TMZ, and the Trump-friendly
 tabloidâ€™s framing â€” â€œKathy Griffin wants Donald Trumpâ€™s head â€¦ but sh
e wants it bloody and detached from his bodyâ€ â€” didnâ€™t ponder any deeper m
eanings. Griffin, perhaps naively, assumed that no one would ever think she actu
ally wants to kill anyone, much less the president of the United States. But tha
tâ€™s exactly what some people thought. 
  
 Chelsea Clinton tweeted, â€œThis is vile and wrong. It is never funny to joke a
bout killing a president.â€ Will & Grace star Debra Messing, who regularly twee
ts about her distaste for Trump, tweeted, â€œIt wasnâ€™t right when peoplel [sic
] hung lynched Obama effigies, just as what Kathy Griffin did isnâ€™t right now.
â€ 
  
 When I first saw the photo on Twitter, I assumed it was a private, unfortunate 
gag that had leaked somehow. (Despite Griffinâ€™s reputation as a shock comic, s
he is also an astute manager of her image and her act who keeps a First Amendmen
t attorney on retainer.) 
  
 I called Griffin as the heat was building, but at that point she wasnâ€™t at al
l concerned. Her first question was, â€œOh, is it getting around?â€ I discourag
ed her from posting the photo on her own accounts, which have millions of follow
ers, but there was no stopping her â€” she told me that she was well-versed in d
ealing with controversy. After it became clear that Griffin stood behind the ima
ge, a brewing controversy turned into a full-on firestorm. Three hours later, I 
got an Instagram alert on my phone: Griffin had posted her apology video. 
  
 It was a call from Rosie Oâ€™Donnell that made Griffin realize the mistake she 
had made. Oâ€™Donnell arguably has had more ire directed at her from Trump than 
any other celebrity, but she confirmed to me that she asked Griffin a simple que
stion: â€œWhat is James Foleyâ€™s mom going to think when she sees this?â€ Fole
y, an American journalist, was beheaded by ISIS in 2014 while on assignment in S
yria. 
  
 Griffinâ€™s apology appeared to satiate her liberal fan base, but Republicans c
ontinued to be outraged. Her hope was that things would calm down over the next 
few days and she could try to return to normal life. But they didnâ€™t. The next
 morning, as many expected, Trump tweeted about the incident: â€œKathy Griffin s
hould be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron,
 are having a hard time with this. Sick!â€ 
  
 The First Lady, Melania Trump, released a statement questioning Griffinâ€™s men
tal health saying, â€œ[A] photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes 
you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it.â€ The reaction fro
m Trumpâ€™s sons and daughter-in-law was even more aggressive. Donald Trump Jr. 
tweeted repeatedly about Griffin and even tweeted at CNN anchor Jake Tapper aski
ng him if Griffin would be fired. Lara Trump, who is married to Trumpâ€™s son Er
ic, appeared on Sean Hannityâ€™s program on Fox News to denounce Griffin. (The W
hite House declined multiple requests to comment on this story.) 
  
 Itâ€™s hard to imagine any other U.S. president, much less his family, going af
ter any entertainer the way Trump and his family went after Griffin. Wilson told
 me that he finds it ironic that Trump, who rode into the White House on a platf
orm of decrying political correctness, has presided over the development of a â€
œhighly refined outrage culture, particularly around himself. There is no humor.
 He and his supporters will go to DEFCON 1 if they sense thereâ€™s something tha
t offends him.â€ Wilson added that he has also dealt with death threats and los
s of business because of his commentary about Trump. 
  
 Sykes and Wilson both tell me they refuse to accept that Trump was truly offend
ed by Griffinâ€™s image. On June 23, it was revealed that Al Baldasaro, a member
 of New Hampshireâ€™s House of Representatives and a top Trump supporter, was a 
guest of Trumpâ€™s at a bill-signing at the White House. During the 2016 campaig
n, Baldasaro said on two occasions that Hillary Clinton should have been shot by
 a firing squad. 
  
 As the photo spread around the internet, Griffinâ€™s social media was flooded w
ith detailed and gruesome death threats. The agency that represented Griffin for
 television work had to shut down their switchboard because they were flooded wi
th angry calls. In the week after, she received death threats via mail â€” some 
of the messages, which I reviewed, were stunning and frightening in their specif
icity. 
  
 Fox News featured the Griffin controversy throughout their programming, and the
ir opinion hosts talked about it length. While many news programs have blurred t
he image of Trumpâ€™s head, Hannity showed it in its original form repeatedly ov
er the past 89 days, even though he claims that the image could incite violence 
against Trump. A Fox News spokeswoman declined an interview on Hannityâ€™s behal
f. 
  
 Thereâ€™s a chance that Griffin could have recovered from the controversy much 
sooner, had she not made the fateful decision to hold a press conference with he
r newly retained attorney Lisa Bloom just three days after the photo was release
d. Bloom, known as an attorney who specializes in womenâ€™s advocacy, is a ubiqu
itous presence on cable television whose fame has increased as she has been reta
ined by clients who have accused President Trump and former Fox News host Bill O
â€™Reilly of sexual assault and harassment, respectively. 
  
 Before the press conference, Griffin received text messages and emails from fri
ends, begging her not to go through with it; they felt it would only further inf
lame the situation. But Griffin felt that she would look erratic if she canceled
, and she was also feeling wounded by all the attacks. It was a disaster: Griffi
n appeared defensive and nervous instead of resolute. She talked as if she had b
een the victim of an unprovoked attack. â€œNone of the points I wanted to make i
n that press conference came across because I said I was a victim and acted like
 a victim. I take responsibility for that,â€ she says. 
  
 In the aftermath, Griffin says she couldnâ€™t even find a reputable crisis-mana
gement expert to take her on as a client, and she still hasnâ€™t found a publici
st. Entreaties from her team are met with responses like, â€œWe arenâ€™t taking 
on new clients right nowâ€ â€” Hollywood speak for â€œwe donâ€™t want you.â€ G
riffin decided to leave WME, the agency that has represented her for television 
projects, but she is staying with her longtime concert agent at ICM. 
  
 Meanwhile, other stars whoâ€™ve made statements that have landed them in the cr
osshairs of the Secret Service â€” like Johnny Depp, who made a Trump assassinat
ion joke on camera â€” have seen the ensuing controversy swiftly go away (it hel
ps that Trump didnâ€™t tweet about Depp). 
  
 For the past two and a half months, Griffin, who says she traveled to 80 cities
 last year as part of her comedy concert tour, has been in hibernation. Sheâ€™s 
gone to five social functions and a few business meetings. In July, Griffinâ€™s 
sister Joyce was diagnosed with cancer and Griffin shaved her head in solidarity
. The thousands of death threats have trickled to mere hundreds. The Secret Serv
ice investigation, after an hour-long interview, remained open for two months, s
toking Griffinâ€™s fear that somehow the levers of government power might be use
d against her, until her lawyer was finally informed that the inquiry had closed
. 
  
 In the past few years, Griffin, who has always been a political junkie, has con
tributed thousands of dollars to elected officials like Barack Obama and Minneso
ta senator Al Franken, according to federal records. She co-hosted a town hall w
ith California congressman Ted Lieu, and sheâ€™s appeared regularly on MSNBC to 
talk about LGBT and womenâ€™s advocacy. Griffin says she was supposed to host a 
fundraiser for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi at her home the week after the
 photo was released. In July, she adds, she was slated to speak at Politicon, a 
convention of political and media leaders from both parties, in Pasadena, Califo
rnia. All of that went away almost immediately. Franken admonished her publicly 
and Pelosiâ€™s office canceled the fundraiser. 
  
 But getting fired by CNN was the most public indignity for Griffin because it i
nvolved business and personal relationships that had been fraught with tension f
or years. Griffin credits CNN president Jeff Zucker with reinvigorating her care
er in 2003 when she was doing stand-up at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles. Acco
rding to EW, Zucker, then president of NBC Entertainment, came to see her act an
d they eventually struck a deal for Griffin to have her own reality show on the 
NBC-owned Bravo Network called My Life on the D-List. 
  
 But since Zucker became CNN chief, he and Griffin had clashed regularly, she sa
ys. New Yearâ€™s Eve is a big money-making opportunity for entertainers, and the
 CNN gig didnâ€™t pay very well. In 2015, Griffin says she called Zucker directl
y to see if he could bump up her compensation. The broadcast was receiving recor
d ratings, Griffin was doing a lot of the work as the comedian to Cooperâ€™s str
aight man, and the broadcast had gone from 90 minutes to four-and-a-half hours s
ince she started doing it. 
  
 Griffin says Zucker was livid and told her that he could get comedian Samantha 
Bee to take her place. Zucker, Griffin says, called her agent and publicist to s
ay she was fired. They eventually made up, but not before Zucker cut Griffinâ€™s
 pay (she did get a raise in 2016). 
  
 Griffin also says that before the 2017 broadcast, Zucker called her at home to 
tell her she could only do four jokes about Trump (the first time there had ever
 been limits on her material during the special). When Griffin pushed back, she 
says Zucker said to her, â€œI donâ€™t need this, you donâ€™t need this. Heâ€™s c
ome after me harder than anybody. I have to deal with this guy.â€ Griffin reluc
tantly agreed to the limit. Zucker, through a CNN spokeswoman, declined to comme
nt. 
  
 Griffinâ€™s best-known celebrity friendship, going back 17 years, is with CNN a
nchor Anderson Cooper. But after TMZ published the photo, Cooper came under trem
endous pressure to repudiate it. Without reaching out to Griffin, he tweeted the
 same night: â€œFor the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin t
ook part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.â€ Griffin a
cknowledges that Cooper was in an untenable position, but she feels that their l
ong friendship afforded her a call or text message beforehand. 
  
 In the following days, Griffin says four of Cooperâ€™s CNN colleagues reached o
ut repeatedly to Griffin to check on her and offer private support (I independen
tly confirmed this). But Cooper didnâ€™t contact Griffin until August 10, CNN co
nfirmed to me. 
  
 On July 26, when asked about Griffin on Andy Cohenâ€™s talk show, Watch What Ha
ppens Live with Andy Cohen, Cooper claimed that Griffin was still a friend. â€œY
eah, weâ€™re still friends, and look I said what I said about â€” I didnâ€™t thi
nk what she said was appropriate, but I wish her the best and I hope she bounces
 back,â€ he told Cohen. 
  
 The fact that Cooper was telling people publicly they were friends, while not c
hecking in with her, hurt Griffin deeply. When he finally reached out to her in 
a series of text messages, she told him their friendship was over. 
  
 A source close to Cooper tells me that Cooper was â€œshocked and upset by the p
hoto, and while he was not ready to talk to her personally about it, he still co
nsidered her to be a friend, and was publicly supportive when asked about the co
ntroversy.â€ 
  
 Other celebrities were more solicitous. Advice and support flooded in from Holl
ywood friends, actors, and comics. One critically revered comedian, Griffin says
, reassured her that her career wasnâ€™t over and that every comic would give th
eir right arm for the act sheâ€™d have after the controversy died down. A comedi
c movie legend said the incident would be a landmark in the way comedy is viewed
. Jerry Seinfeld and Jamie Foxx made supportive comments publicly. Amy Schumer s
ent Griffin a funny video that Griffin played for me but declined to let me desc
ribe. When a couple who live in her gated community, but whom Griffin had never 
known or met, dropped off a cake and a note, Griffin was so touched that she bro
ke down crying in her bed. 
  
 Despite all the private support, no entertainers were willing to speak to me on
 the record about Griffin. For this story, I reached out to a number of celebrit
ies, especially comics, that Griffin is close friends with. Theyâ€™ve been calli
ng and texting Griffin in the past few months to check in on her. A few of them 
even initially told me that they would talk to me for this story, but when I rea
ched out to their publicists to set up phone interviews, I was politely turned a
way. 
  
 There was also some unsolicited advice. An iconic actress told Griffin to stay 
at home and out of the limelight until Trump was impeached (itâ€™s unclear when 
the actress thought that would happen). Former Today show host Billy Bush, who k
nows what getting caught up in a Trump-related scandal is like, suggested, in a 
note Griffin shared with me, that she stay quiet for a while and take up meditat
ion. 
  
 The most disturbing advice came via email from a member of the board of directo
rs of the CBS Corporation, Arnold Kopelson, an Academy Awardâ€“winning producer 
who Griffin used to consider a friend. Kopelson emailed Griffin with a prewritte
n letter to President Trump that he said she should mail to him, and which Griff
in shared with me. 
  
 The letter includes phrases like, â€œNow with my world crumbling around me, I a
m listening for the first time about the great things you have done and are doin
g. How stupid I was to follow the lies from the â€˜Left.â€™ It took my terrible 
mistake to finally see the false news,â€ and â€œI do not deserve what I am aski
ng of you. I am begging you to open your heart and forgive me.â€ Kopelson said 
that Griffin should â€œexclusively release the letter to Fox Broadcasting,â€ ad
ding, â€œDo not send to the other networks.â€ â€œIf you donâ€™t do exactly what
 Iâ€™ve written, your career is over,â€ Kopelson wrote. A spokesman for CBS Cor
poration declined to comment. When I called Kopelson for comment, he said, â€œIâ
€™m tied upâ€ as soon as I explained the reason for the call, and hung up the p
hone. Kopelson did not respond to a request for comment via email. 
  
 Griffin tells me that Kopelsonâ€™s email was indicative of â€œmen who control t
he checkbooks,â€ who, despite the entertainment industryâ€™s liberal reputation
, tend to be more conservative and donâ€™t like people who rock the boat. She ac
knowledged that revealing details about people like Kopelson, Cooper, and Zucker
 is unusual, and could harm her future employment prospects. 
  
 But Griffin occupies an unusual space in comedy: Like her late friend and mento
r Joan Rivers, she has constantly struggled to be taken seriously, but managed t
o build a substantial fan base that has enriched her and made her very famous. H
er concert agent showed me Ticketmaster data indicating that over the past 13 ye
ars, Griffin has sold over 1.2 million tickets to her shows. 
  
 Griffin says she wants to focus on First Amendment issues now. Sheâ€™s hoping t
o organize a First Amendment concert with the ACLU, and sheâ€™s working on a doc
umentary film of her upcoming international tour, as well as a docu-series, alth
ough none of these projects has come to fruition yet. 
  
 In the meantime, although sheâ€™s still too worried about her physical safety t
o tour America, Griffin is off around the world. Her act will feature plenty of 
Trump jokes, despite the fact that some of her friends have suggested she take i
t easy on the president for a while. 
  
 Rick Wilson thinks she has no alternative. â€œThe way Trump wins is if he shuts
 people up permanently and scares them off from being vocal critics,â€ he said.
 â€œShe has to go back to war.â€

 promotional video she just released for her new Laugh Your Head Off tour of Eur
ope, Australia, and New Zealand concludes with an image of her in the same blous
e she wore in the infamous Trump photo, holding a globe in her hand instead of a
 Trump mask. And sheâ€™s still angry with the president. 
  
 â€œPresident Trump just pardoned Joe Arpaio, who was essentially running a conc
entration camp in the Arizona desert,â€ she tells me over the phone this past w
eekend. â€œHe said there are some good Nazis, and heâ€™s kicking out young adult
s who were brought here as kids by their parents, and Iâ€™m the one who has to c
ontinue to apologize?â€ 
  
 Between these two conversations, I visited Griffin at her home in Los Angeles a
 number of times (we first met a dozen years ago at a party; in the last year, a
fter she reached out to me via Twitter DM, we began discussing politics regularl
y). She paid $10.5 million last year for a 13,000-square-foot mansion with all t
he trappings; her next-door neighbors are Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. â€œIâ€™
ve moved in next door to my act!â€ she tells me. (She says theyâ€™re excellent 
neighbors and donâ€™t make any noise. When I was with Griffin, Kardashian sent h
er a text message to see how she was feeling.) 
  
 Griffin, who made her career by mocking celebrities, is not the most likely com
edian to be martyred over the inalienable right to criticize the president. But 
in the past couple of years, her act has become more and more political. She say
s that has led some of her fans to bristle. â€œComedians talk about what their a
udience is faced with every day, we try to relate to our audience,â€ she says. 
â€œIâ€™m obsessed with politics. I always have been, and now, with Trump, many p
eople are obsessed with politics, so thatâ€™s going to be a big part of my act.â
€ 
  
 In the course of our talks, the theme she returned to most forcefully was the r
ight to provoke with humor. Griffin describes a visit to an LGBT center in Los A
ngeles, during which an AIDS patient asked her to mock him so he could feel norm
al, as a defining moment in her career, and an example of the value of seemingly
 outrageous comedy. â€œI would be abandoning my principles as a comic and a huma
n being if I backed off President Trump or any public person,â€ she tells me. â
€œComics by their nature are anti-Establishment. They are charged with the often
 unenviable task of going after people in power. I will never abdicate that resp
onsibility.â€ 
  
 Griffin fears the impact of what happened to her will resonate further. â€œWhen
 the president tweeted about me the morning after I released the image, it serve
d as an executive order of sorts to his family and supporters to go after me,â€
 she says. â€œYou may say I deserved it, but just think about it â€¦ the preside
nt of the United States and his family are going after a stand-up comic who had 
a show on the Bravo network called My Life on the D-List. If that isnâ€™t punchi
ng down, I donâ€™t know what is.â€ 
  
 Griffin says she isnâ€™t a victim: â€œI am in a position of privilege, I will b
e fine,â€ she says. â€œBut what about any American citizen, whether theyâ€™re a
rtists or not, who innocently post a shocking photo on social media â€” will the
y face a federal investigation?â€ Griffin also worries about the â€œchilling ef
fectâ€ created by the retribution wielded by a vengeful president and his army 
of supporters. She thinks that just as sheâ€™s taken responsibility for her prov
ocative image, Trump â€œhas to take responsibility for the power he holds with h
is Twitter account.â€ 
  
 Even if one agrees with Griffinâ€™s sentiments, itâ€™s fair to wonder what the 
image of Trumpâ€™s severed head signified beyond the obvious interpretation, and
 whether Griffin should have realized how much blowback it would create, given t
he hyperpolarized media environment that surrounds the president. 
  
 Rick Wilson, a longtime Republican political consultant who denounced Trump ear
ly and hasnâ€™t wavered since, says he found Griffinâ€™s image â€œway outside th
e boundaries and unhelpful against the cause. I understand how strong passions a
gainst Trump run, mine do very frequently, but people are always looking for rea
sons to delegitimize you.â€ Charlie Sykes, a conservative political commentator
 and former radio host who is famously anti-Trump, tells me that Griffin gave Tr
ump and his supporters a big gift by releasing the image. â€œThe moment I saw th
e picture, I knew [the outcry from Trump and his supporters] was going to happen
. Itâ€™s a useful meme for Trump: Itâ€™s the left that incites violence, itâ€™s 
the left that engages in hate.â€

 The photos were improvised in an afternoon: Tyler Shields, a celebrity photogra
pher known for his provocative images (he once shot an image of a black man hang
ing a member of the KKK), was taking some updated portraits of Griffin, and afte
rward, they decided to create some spoof images involving Trump. Griffin dispatc
hed her assistant to find a Trump mask and a friend made fake blood using ketchu
p. They wanted to comment on Trumpâ€™s infamous comments about Megyn Kelly â€” â
€œblood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her whereverâ€ â€” after sh
e questioned him about his history of sexist comments in the first Republican pr
esidential debate in 2015. 
  
 With Griffinâ€™s permission, Shields (who did not respond to requests for comme
nt) released the image â€” although he didnâ€™t tell her where it would go first
. Shields, according to Griffin, chose to give it to TMZ, and the Trump-friendly
 tabloidâ€™s framing â€” â€œKathy Griffin wants Donald Trumpâ€™s head â€¦ but sh
e wants it bloody and detached from his bodyâ€ â€” didnâ€™t ponder any deeper m
eanings. Griffin, perhaps naively, assumed that no one would ever think she actu
ally wants to kill anyone, much less the president of the United States. But tha
tâ€™s exactly what some people thought. 
  
 Chelsea Clinton tweeted, â€œThis is vile and wrong. It is never funny to joke a
bout killing a president.â€ Will & Grace star Debra Messing, who regularly twee
ts about her distaste for Trump, tweeted, â€œIt wasnâ€™t right when peoplel [sic
] hung lynched Obama effigies, just as what Kathy Griffin did isnâ€™t right now.
â€ 
  
 When I first saw the photo on Twitter, I assumed it was a private, unfortunate 
gag that had leaked somehow. (Despite Griffinâ€™s reputation as a shock comic, s
he is also an astute manager of her image and her act who keeps a First Amendmen
t attorney on retainer.) 
  
 I called Griffin as the heat was building, but at that point she wasnâ€™t at al
l concerned. Her first question was, â€œOh, is it getting around?â€ I discourag
ed her from posting the photo on her own accounts, which have millions of follow
ers, but there was no stopping her â€” she told me that she was well-versed in d
ealing with controversy. After it became clear that Griffin stood behind the ima
ge, a brewing controversy turned into a full-on firestorm. Three hours later, I 
got an Instagram alert on my phone: Griffin had posted her apology video. 
  
 It was a call from Rosie Oâ€™Donnell that made Griffin realize the mistake she 
had made. Oâ€™Donnell arguably has had more ire directed at her from Trump than 
any other celebrity, but she confirmed to me that she asked Griffin a simple que
stion: â€œWhat is James Foleyâ€™s mom going to think when she sees this?â€ Fole
y, an American journalist, was beheaded by ISIS in 2014 while on assignment in S
yria. 
  
 Griffinâ€™s apology appeared to satiate her liberal fan base, but Republicans c
ontinued to be outraged. Her hope was that things would calm down over the next 
few days and she could try to return to normal life. But they didnâ€™t. The next
 morning, as many expected, Trump tweeted about the incident: â€œKathy Griffin s
hould be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron,
 are having a hard time with this. Sick!â€ 
  
 The First Lady, Melania Trump, released a statement questioning Griffinâ€™s men
tal health saying, â€œ[A] photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes 
you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it.â€ The reaction fro
m Trumpâ€™s sons and daughter-in-law was even more aggressive. Donald Trump Jr. 
tweeted repeatedly about Griffin and even tweeted at CNN anchor Jake Tapper aski
ng him if Griffin would be fired. Lara Trump, who is married to Trumpâ€™s son Er
ic, appeared on Sean Hannityâ€™s program on Fox News to denounce Griffin. (The W
hite House declined multiple requests to comment on this story.) 
  
 Itâ€™s hard to imagine any other U.S. president, much less his family, going af
ter any entertainer the way Trump and his family went after Griffin. Wilson told
 me that he finds it ironic that Trump, who rode into the White House on a platf
orm of decrying political correctness, has presided over the development of a â€
œhighly refined outrage culture, particularly around himself. There is no humor.
 He and his supporters will go to DEFCON 1 if they sense thereâ€™s something tha
t offends him.â€ Wilson added that he has also dealt with death threats and los
s of business because of his commentary about Trump. 
  
 Sykes and Wilson both tell me they refuse to accept that Trump was truly offend
ed by Griffinâ€™s image. On June 23, it was revealed that Al Baldasaro, a member
 of New Hampshireâ€™s House of Representatives and a top Trump supporter, was a 
guest of Trumpâ€™s at a bill-signing at the White House. During the 2016 campaig
n, Baldasaro said on two occasions that Hillary Clinton should have been shot by
 a firing squad. 
  
 As the photo spread around the internet, Griffinâ€™s social media was flooded w
ith detailed and gruesome death threats. The agency that represented Griffin for
 television work had to shut down their switchboard because they were flooded wi
th angry calls. In the week after, she received death threats via mail â€” some 
of the messages, which I reviewed, were stunning and frightening in their specif
icity. 
  
 Fox News featured the Griffin controversy throughout their programming, and the
ir opinion hosts talked about it length. While many news programs have blurred t
he image of Trumpâ€™s head, Hannity showed it in its original form repeatedly ov
er the past 89 days, even though he claims that the image could incite violence 
against Trump. A Fox News spokeswoman declined an interview on Hannityâ€™s behal
f. 
  
 Thereâ€™s a chance that Griffin could have recovered from the controversy much 
sooner, had she not made the fateful decision to hold a press conference with he
r newly retained attorney Lisa Bloom just three days after the photo was release
d. Bloom, known as an attorney who specializes in womenâ€™s advocacy, is a ubiqu
itous presence on cable television whose fame has increased as she has been reta
ined by clients who have accused President Trump and former Fox News host Bill O
â€™Reilly of sexual assault and harassment, respectively. 
  
 Before the press conference, Griffin received text messages and emails from fri
ends, begging her not to go through with it; they felt it would only further inf
lame the situation. But Griffin felt that she would look erratic if she canceled
, and she was also feeling wounded by all the attacks. It was a disaster: Griffi
n appeared defensive and nervous instead of resolute. She talked as if she had b
een the victim of an unprovoked attack. â€œNone of the points I wanted to make i
n that press conference came across because I said I was a victim and acted like
 a victim. I take responsibility for that,â€ she says. 
  
 In the aftermath, Griffin says she couldnâ€™t even find a reputable crisis-mana
gement expert to take her on as a client, and she still hasnâ€™t found a publici
st. Entreaties from her team are met with responses like, â€œWe arenâ€™t taking 
on new clients right nowâ€ â€” Hollywood speak for â€œwe donâ€™t want you.â€ G
riffin decided to leave WME, the agency that has represented her for television 
projects, but she is staying with her longtime concert agent at ICM. 
  
 Meanwhile, other stars whoâ€™ve made statements that have landed them in the cr
osshairs of the Secret Service â€” like Johnny Depp, who made a Trump assassinat
ion joke on camera â€” have seen the ensuing controversy swiftly go away (it hel
ps that Trump didnâ€™t tweet about Depp). 
  
 For the past two and a half months, Griffin, who says she traveled to 80 cities
 last year as part of her comedy concert tour, has been in hibernation. Sheâ€™s 
gone to five social functions and a few business meetings. In July, Griffinâ€™s 
sister Joyce was diagnosed with cancer and Griffin shaved her head in solidarity
. The thousands of death threats have trickled to mere hundreds. The Secret Serv
ice investigation, after an hour-long interview, remained open for two months, s
toking Griffinâ€™s fear that somehow the levers of government power might be use
d against her, until her lawyer was finally informed that the inquiry had closed
. 
  
 In the past few years, Griffin, who has always been a political junkie, has con
tributed thousands of dollars to elected officials like Barack Obama and Minneso
ta senator Al Franken, according to federal records. She co-hosted a town hall w
ith California congressman Ted Lieu, and sheâ€™s appeared regularly on MSNBC to 
talk about LGBT and womenâ€™s advocacy. Griffin says she was supposed to host a 
fundraiser for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi at her home the week after the
 photo was released. In July, she adds, she was slated to speak at Politicon, a 
convention of political and media leaders from both parties, in Pasadena, Califo
rnia. All of that went away almost immediately. Franken admonished her publicly 
and Pelosiâ€™s office canceled the fundraiser. 
  
 But getting fired by CNN was the most public indignity for Griffin because it i
nvolved business and personal relationships that had been fraught with tension f
or years. Griffin credits CNN president Jeff Zucker with reinvigorating her care
er in 2003 when she was doing stand-up at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles. Acco
rding to EW, Zucker, then president of NBC Entertainment, came to see her act an
d they eventually struck a deal for Griffin to have her own reality show on the 
NBC-owned Bravo Network called My Life on the D-List. 
  
 But since Zucker became CNN chief, he and Griffin had clashed regularly, she sa
ys. New Yearâ€™s Eve is a big money-making opportunity for entertainers, and the
 CNN gig didnâ€™t pay very well. In 2015, Griffin says she called Zucker directl
y to see if he could bump up her compensation. The broadcast was receiving recor
d ratings, Griffin was doing a lot of the work as the comedian to Cooperâ€™s str
aight man, and the broadcast had gone from 90 minutes to four-and-a-half hours s
ince she started doing it. 
  
 Griffin says Zucker was livid and told her that he could get comedian Samantha 
Bee to take her place. Zucker, Griffin says, called her agent and publicist to s
ay she was fired. They eventually made up, but not before Zucker cut Griffinâ€™s
 pay (she did get a raise in 2016). 
  
 Griffin also says that before the 2017 broadcast, Zucker called her at home to 
tell her she could only do four jokes about Trump (the first time there had ever
 been limits on her material during the special). When Griffin pushed back, she 
says Zucker said to her, â€œI donâ€™t need this, you donâ€™t need this. Heâ€™s c
ome after me harder than anybody. I have to deal with this guy.â€ Griffin reluc
tantly agreed to the limit. Zucker, through a CNN spokeswoman, declined to comme
nt. 
  
 Griffinâ€™s best-known celebrity friendship, going back 17 years, is with CNN a
nchor Anderson Cooper. But after TMZ published the photo, Cooper came under trem
endous pressure to repudiate it. Without reaching out to Griffin, he tweeted the
 same night: â€œFor the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin t
ook part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.â€ Griffin a
cknowledges that Cooper was in an untenable position, but she feels that their l
ong friendship afforded her a call or text message beforehand. 
  
 In the following days, Griffin says four of Cooperâ€™s CNN colleagues reached o
ut repeatedly to Griffin to check on her and offer private support (I independen
tly confirmed this). But Cooper didnâ€™t contact Griffin until August 10, CNN co
nfirmed to me. 
  
 On July 26, when asked about Griffin on Andy Cohenâ€™s talk show, Watch What Ha
ppens Live with Andy Cohen, Cooper claimed that Griffin was still a friend. â€œY
eah, weâ€™re still friends, and look I said what I said about â€” I didnâ€™t thi
nk what she said was appropriate, but I wish her the best and I hope she bounces
 back,â€ he told Cohen. 
  
 The fact that Cooper was telling people publicly they were friends, while not c
hecking in with her, hurt Griffin deeply. When he finally reached out to her in 
a series of text messages, she told him their friendship was over. 
  
 A source close to Cooper tells me that Cooper was â€œshocked and upset by the p
hoto, and while he was not ready to talk to her personally about it, he still co
nsidered her to be a friend, and was publicly supportive when asked about the co
ntroversy.â€ 
  
 Other celebrities were more solicitous. Advice and support flooded in from Holl
ywood friends, actors, and comics. One critically revered comedian, Griffin says
, reassured her that her career wasnâ€™t over and that every comic would give th
eir right arm for the act sheâ€™d have after the controversy died down. A comedi
c movie legend said the incident would be a landmark in the way comedy is viewed
. Jerry Seinfeld and Jamie Foxx made supportive comments publicly. Amy Schumer s
ent Griffin a funny video that Griffin played for me but declined to let me desc
ribe. When a couple who live in her gated community, but whom Griffin had never 
known or met, dropped off a cake and a note, Griffin was so touched that she bro
ke down crying in her bed. 
  
 Despite all the private support, no entertainers were willing to speak to me on
 the record about Griffin. For this story, I reached out to a number of celebrit
ies, especially comics, that Griffin is close friends with. Theyâ€™ve been calli
ng and texting Griffin in the past few months to check in on her. A few of them 
even initially told me that they would talk to me for this story, but when I rea
ched out to their publicists to set up phone interviews, I was politely turned a
way. 
  
 There was also some unsolicited advice. An iconic actress told Griffin to stay 
at home and out of the limelight until Trump was impeached (itâ€™s unclear when 
the actress thought that would happen). Former Today show host Billy Bush, who k
nows what getting caught up in a Trump-related scandal is like, suggested, in a 
note Griffin shared with me, that she stay quiet for a while and take up meditat
ion. 
  
 The most disturbing advice came via email from a member of the board of directo
rs of the CBS Corporation, Arnold Kopelson, an Academy Awardâ€“winning producer 
who Griffin used to consider a friend. Kopelson emailed Griffin with a prewritte
n letter to President Trump that he said she should mail to him, and which Griff
in shared with me. 
  
 The letter includes phrases like, â€œNow with my world crumbling around me, I a
m listening for the first time about the great things you have done and are doin
g. How stupid I was to follow the lies from the â€˜Left.â€™ It took my terrible 
mistake to finally see the false news,â€ and â€œI do not deserve what I am aski
ng of you. I am begging you to open your heart and forgive me.â€ Kopelson said 
that Griffin should â€œexclusively release the letter to Fox Broadcasting,â€ ad
ding, â€œDo not send to the other networks.â€ â€œIf you donâ€™t do exactly what
 Iâ€™ve written, your career is over,â€ Kopelson wrote. A spokesman for CBS Cor
poration declined to comment. When I called Kopelson for comment, he said, â€œIâ
€™m tied upâ€ as soon as I explained the reason for the call, and hung up the p
hone. Kopelson did not respond to a request for comment via email. 
  
 Griffin tells me that Kopelsonâ€™s email was indicative of â€œmen who control t
he checkbooks,â€ who, despite the entertainment industryâ€™s liberal reputation
, tend to be more conservative and donâ€™t like people who rock the boat. She ac
knowledged that revealing details about people like Kopelson, Cooper, and Zucker
 is unusual, and could harm her future employment prospects. 
  
 But Griffin occupies an unusual space in comedy: Like her late friend and mento
r Joan Rivers, she has constantly struggled to be taken seriously, but managed t
o build a substantial fan base that has enriched her and made her very famous. H
er concert agent showed me Ticketmaster data indicating that over the past 13 ye
ars, Griffin has sold over 1.2 million tickets to her shows. 
  
 Griffin says she wants to focus on First Amendment issues now. Sheâ€™s hoping t
o organize a First Amendment concert with the ACLU, and sheâ€™s working on a doc
umentary film of her upcoming international tour, as well as a docu-series, alth
ough none of these projects has come to fruition yet. 
  
 In the meantime, although sheâ€™s still too worried about her physical safety t
o tour America, Griffin is off around the world. Her act will feature plenty of 
Trump jokes, despite the fact that some of her friends have suggested she take i
t easy on the president for a while. 
  
 Rick Wilson thinks she has no alternative. â€œThe way Trump wins is if he shuts
 people up permanently and scares them off from being vocal critics,â€ he said.
 â€œShe has to go back to war.â€
