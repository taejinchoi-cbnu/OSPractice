By . Daily Mail Reporter . Nicola Benedetti, whose album Homecoming: A Scottish 
Fantasy has entered the top 20 of the UK Official Album chart . She became BBC Y
oung Musician of the Year when she was 16, was named one of Britainâ€™s most pow
erful young women earlier this year and already has an MBE and eight honorary de
grees. But Nicola Benedetti has added yet another string to her bow. Yesterday s
he became the first solo British violinist since the 1990s to enter the Top 20 o
f the official UK albums chart with her record Homecoming: A Scottish Fantasy. S
he is also the first ever Scottish classical artist to enter the Top 20. Itâ€™s 
at number 19 and expected to rise. The last British violinist to score a Top 20 
album as a solo performer was Vanessa Mae in 1995. Nigel Kennedy achieved the sa
me feat in 1989. Miss Benedetti, who is due to perform at the opening ceremony o
f the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, said: â€˜I am absolutely thrilled to have r
eached the Top 20, not something a classical artist ever expects. This is a deep
ly personal recording inspired by Bruchâ€™s Scottish Fantasy. 'The project took 
me deep into the heart of Scottish culture. I hope the music, in all its diversi
ty, is providing some upliftÂ  and pleasure.â€™ Earlier this year the 26-year-ol
d lashed out at critics who claim glamorous classical musicians succeed because 
of their sexy image rather than their artistic ability. She said it amounted to 
sexism when talented female artists were judged on their looks, adding: â€˜Class
ical music can be prouder of its integrity than many industries. People are basi
cally chosen for their ability.â€™ Miss Benedettiâ€™s latest achievement follows
 her MBE in 2013 for her educational and charity work. She was named in Britainâ
€™s Top 30: The Young Female Power List, published in the Times in February, alo
ngside the likes of Adele, Emma Watson and the Duchess of Cambridge. Miss Benede
tti's latest achievement follows her MBE in 2013 for her educational and charity
 work . Her rendition of Scottish Fantasy, a piece of classical music written in
 1880 by the German romantic composer Max Bruch, now sits in the mainstream char
t alongside pop acts such as Will.i.am â€“ a judge on BBC talent show The Voice.
 The number one spot was claimed by the rapper and producer. His new single has 
gone straight in at the top of the charts to give him his 10th UK number one. It
â€™s My Birthday, featuring 17-year-old American singer Cody Wise, tops the pile
 11 years after The Voice judgeâ€™s first number one, 2003â€™s Black Eyed Peas h
it Where Is The Love, . He knocked reigning chart queens Ariana Grande and Iggy 
Azalea down to two with Problem, while Ella Henderson also slides one to number 
three with Ghost, according to the Official Chart Company. The pop star now has 
five solo number one singles in Britain, the same as he has with the Black Eyed 
Peas.
