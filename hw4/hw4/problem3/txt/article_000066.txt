Azelle Rodney, 24, died in 2005 after being shot by a former police officer, kno
wn only as E7, as police sought to move in on him over a double stabbing . Firea
rms officers are threatening industrial action after a former policeman was char
ged with murdering a drug dealer during a Scotland Yard operation. Armed officer
s are said to be considering a staged walk-out after it was confirmed that the e
x-officer will stand trial over the 2005 death of Azelle Rodney, who died in a h
ail of bullets when his car was stopped by police marksmen. Rodney, 24, was hit 
six times, once each in the arm and back, and fatally four times in the head in 
Edgware, north London. The man accused of murdering him, only the third policema
n to be charged with committing murder in the course of his duties, can only be 
identified as E7 after being granted anonymity during a public inquiry. The secr
ecy order, made in accordance with Article 8 of the Human Rights Act which grant
s people the right to a family life, could be lifted when the ex-officer makes h
is first appearance in court in September. The decision to charge E7 was welcome
d by Rodneyâ€™s mother, who has campaigned for justice for nearly a decade and m
ay be in line for a huge compensation payout from the Met. But it has left Scotl
and Yard chiefs worried about possible â€˜industrial actionâ€™ by some police fi
rearms officers who might lay down their weapons in support of their former coll
eague. Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman, the national lead for armed poli
cing, said the move to charge E7 had left officers shocked. He told The Times: â
€˜Firearms officers volunteer for the role and many are now considering their fu
ture career choices. â€˜Officers are not above the law and they are accountable 
for their individual decisions, but carrying a gun on behalf of the state is a b
ig ask and it just got bigger.â€™ The decision to charge E7 comes after a three-
month public inquiry into Rodneyâ€™s death, led by former judge Sir Christopher 
Holland. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said: â€˜We have carefu
lly considered the new file of evidence submitted to us and have decided that a 
former Metropolitan Police officer, currently identified only as E7, will be pro
secuted for murder. The individual currently has anonymity.â€™ The murder suspec
t will appear at Westminster Magistratesâ€™ Court on September 10. The shooting 
took place outside The Railway Tavern on . Hale Lane in . Edgware, north London.
 Forensic experts are pictured at the crime scene after the incident took place 
in April 2005 . After . the findings of a public inquiry into Mr Rodney's death 
were published, . his mother Susan . Alexander, pictured middle, called for an i
nvestigation to be opened. She is pictured with lawyer Daniel Machover, right an

exander said: â€˜I am very pleased at the decision to prosecute the officer who 
killed my son. I have waited a long time to see this day and hope this prosecuti
on will lead to justice for Azelle.â€™ Rodney was hit by eight shots in less tha
n two seconds from a high-powered carbine at almost point blank range. The round
s were fired from the open window of a patrol car within a split second of pulli
ng alongside the VW Golf carrying Rodney. The murder charge against E7 is . beli
eved to be only the third time in recent years that an officer has . been charge
d with murder while on active duty. PC . Chris Sherwood from Sussex Police was a
cquitted of murder in 2001, . after he shot James Ashley, 39, while he was naked
 and unarmed. The shooting had taken place while police searched his flat in Has
tings, East Sussex. The officer said he believed Mr Ashley was mistakenly pointi
ng a gun at him and was about to shoot. The . Chief Constable of Sussex, Martin 
Richards, who was the nominal . defendant in the civil case that followed, admit
ted negligence and . agreed to pay the family damages. But the force always stro
ngly denied misconduct. In . an earlier case - and believed to be the first of i
ts kind - . Metropolitan Police PC Patrick Hodgson was cleared at the Old Bailey
 of . the murder and manslaughter of suspected car thief David Ewin, 38. He stoo
d trial three times after the jury failed to deliver a verdict on the first two 
occasions. He had always denied both the murder and manslaughter of Mr Ewin in B
arnes, south west London, in February 2005. The . officer, then 49, was part of 
the crew of an armed response vehicle . that had spotted the stolen Toyota sport
s car parked outside a shop. Mr Ewin died from his injuries after the shooting. 
Officer E7 claimed he feared Rodney was about to fire a submachine gun. Wesley L
ovell and Frank Graham, the other occupants of the VW Golf, were jailed for seve
n and six years respectively in January 2006 after pleading guilty to possession
 of firearms. Lovell was also convicted of allowing drug production in his Hamme
rsmith home. In court he claimed that he had let Rodney use his flat as a crack 
factory to cancel out a drugs debt. At the time of his death Rodney was wanted o
ver a double stabbing in Ealing. There have only been two previous cases where p
olice officers were charged with murder. In 1997 Metropolitan Police PC Patrick 
Hodgson was cleared of the 1995 murder of suspected car thief David Ewin in Barn
es, south-west London. The second related to PC Chris Sherwood, who was accused 
of murder after he shot suspected drug dealer James Ashley while he was naked an
d unarmed when officers searched his flat in St Leonards, East Sussex, in 1998. 
He was cleared in 2001. Leaders of the Police Federation, which represents more 
than 125,000 rank and file officers, held discussions about firearms officers co
nducting â€˜unofficial strikesâ€™ when marksmen faced the prospect of being char
ged with murder in two other cases. The shootings of unarmed decorator Harry Sta
nley in 1999 and Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes in 2005 were mired in controv
ersy but possible walkouts were averted when prosecutors ruled out murder charge
s. E7 has been supported in his legal battle by the Metropolitan branch of the P
olice Federation, whose chairman John Tully said: â€˜Parallels may be drawn with
 the Harry Stanley case going back a number of years when two officers were arre
sted. â€˜At the time there were concerns about the lack of support from senior m
anagement and Government. Itâ€™s a very difficult job.â€™ But he added: â€˜I hav
e not detected any similar feelings in the workforce currently. It could have an
 impact on morale.â€™ The Police Firearms Officers Association said the case had
 raised many issues. A spokesman said: â€˜The decision by the CPS to prosecute E
7 raises many issues around the role of armed policing and officers having confi
dence in the law should they be involved in a shooting.â€™ Sorry we are not curr
