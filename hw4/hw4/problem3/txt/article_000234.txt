Could you give up the internet for Lent -Â  or even for good? Following various 
reports about companies stealing information and complaints about oversharing on
 social media, a web hosting firm has created a nine-step guide on how to disapp
ear from the web completely. It includes deactivating accounts, removing links f
rom search results and how to remove yourself from various lists - and for peopl
e who'd rather just stay hidden than disappear, the guide also gives tips on how
 to use the internet anonymously. The infographic, pictured, from London-based W
hoIsHostingThis, details the nine steps needed to remove yourself from the web. 
It includes deactivating accounts, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Googl
e+ . 1. Close your Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and LinkedIn accounts. 2. Search f
or yourself online and close any accounts you'd forgotten about. 3. Falsify info
rmation on accounts that can't be closed or deleted. 4. Unsubscribe from mailing
 lists. 5. Delete search engine results. 6. Contact websites directly and ask th
em to remove details about yourself. 7. Ask data clearing houses - companies tha
t collect and sell data to other firms -Â  to remove your records. 8. Ask to be 
unlisted in phone books and online directories. 9. Delete your email accounts. '
Social media has made everyoneâ€™s life an open book - one thatâ€™s open a bit t
oo far in some cases. â€˜For [people] concerned about their personal information
 potentially costing them jobs and relationships, the decision to â€˜pull the pl
ugâ€™ is an increasingly attractive one,' said London-based WhoIsHostingThis (WI

uth is you can disappear online with a little effort and dedication.' There are 
a number of sites that can help users delete their information, such as DeleteMe
 and JustDelete.me. However, for people who want to do the job manually, WhoIsHo

mpletely. The first step involves deactivating primary accounts, such as Faceboo

ogle has a URL removal tool, for example. However, Google is not obliged to remo
ve links - especially if the website is owned or hosted by another company. In t
his instance, WIHT recommends contacting the website directly and asking them to
 remove any references. There are also services, known as data clearing houses, 
that collect information from sites to sell to advertisers, for example. WIHT ad
