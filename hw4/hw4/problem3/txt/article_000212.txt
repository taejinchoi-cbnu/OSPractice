an all agree on this one: Never put things to a public online vote. 
  
 The Natural Environment Research Council is learning that lesson, but it could 
be a lot worse. 
  
 The NERC, which is an independent environmental science organization in the Uni
ted Kingdom, is in the process of building a new $300 million Antarctic survey v
essel. 
  
 Boat needs a name, right? Why not put it to a public vote, yea?

 Well, the public is voting overwhelmingly to name the ship "Boaty McBoatface." 
  
 Now, in the grand scheme of Internet shenanigans, "Boaty McBoatface" is not rea
lly that bad. In this writer's opinion, it's actually pretty great. After all, t
his is the same Internet that responded to a promotion to name a new flavor of M
ountain Dew with "Hitler did nothing wrong" and "Fapple." 
  
 Other examples of Internet votes gone horribly wrong include a promotion that e
nded up sending the entertainer Pitbull to a Walmart in Alaska. 
  
 Thus far, Boaty McBoatface has a commanding lead with more than 21,000 votes. I
t's next closest competitor, "Henry Worsley," an explorer and former British arm
y officer who died in January during an attempt to become the first person to cr
oss Antartica unaided, has a little more than 2,700 votes. 
  
 The vote has spurred a hashtag — #BoatyMcBoatface of course — and even caus
ed intermittent outages for its website.

2019. |||||
