Bronca, Diego Maradona called it. The emotion was his driving force throughout h
is career. Marcela Mora y Araujo, translator of his autobiography El Diego, desc
ribed it as representing â€˜anger, fury, hatred, resentment and bitter disconten
tâ€™. It would appear Luis Suarez, perhaps the player most like Maradona at this
 World Cup, is motivated by bronca, too. Nothing else explains his mood swings, 
his brilliant destructiveness, the intensity of his creative blaze and sudden se
lf-immolation. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the moment Suarez appears to bite Chie
llini . Passion: Luis Suarez seems to be driven by an emotion referred to by Die
go Maradona as bronca . Driven: Maradona claimed bronca represented his 'anger, 
fury, hatred, resentment and bitter discontent' Suarez was angry long before he 
sank his teeth into defender Giorgio Chiellini. He was angry after defeating Eng
land the week before, angry on the eve of the final group meeting with Italy, to
o. He used every opportunity to rail against his critics, his detractors in Engl
and, those who dare to suggest that football is better without racism, cheating 
and acts of aggravated bodily harm. It is as if he possesses dual personalities.
 There is the Suarez whom team-mates recognise, and he is a universally popular 
figure. This Suarez gives selflessly for his team, is a disciplined and dedicate
d trainer and a quiet family man, still devoted to his childhood sweetheart and 
their young family. Controversy: Suarez (9) clearly moves in to bite Italian def
ender Giorgio Chiellini . Then there is the Suarez possessed by bronca, uncontro
lled, without boundaries, illogical. Viewed together this pair make no sense, Je
kyll and Hyde but without the potions. It does not follow that Suarez can depart
 from reality into a state where he is moved to bite another human being. It doe
s not follow that this behaviour is repeated, that it has a pattern immune to ce
nsure or judgement. What Suarez does baffles all understanding. It is as if he i
s, in the truest sense of the phrase, out of his mind. If it were possible to re
view a substantial library of great and important goals that had been scored by 
virtue of biting an opponent, it would not make his behaviour correct, but it wo
uld at least begin to explain the motivation. If there were games that had been 
won only because of occlusive biting, there could at least be understanding. We 
do not condone diving or simulation in the area, either, but we accept it can ge
t results. Flashpoint: Suarez holds his teeth in pain after the incident during 
Uruguay 1-0 Italy . Yet what Suarez does can only have a negative effect. At wor
st, he is sent off, or banned, if spotted. At best? Well, what is the positive o
utcome here? Chiellini was not going to become incapacitated, unable to continue
 due to his injuries. Biting, while horrible, is in fact a rather inefficient wa
y of gaining advantage over an opponent. The best Suarez could hope for was shoc
k. Yet Englandâ€™s defenders also looked pretty shocked in Sao Paulo, and no tee
th were bared to achieve that outcome. Suarez is at his least dangerous when he 
opens his mouth. It is his feet, and his brain, that terrify, combining to provi
de the movement, instinct and clinical nature that are his most effective qualit
ies. Biting, Suarez is almost worthless. Shocking: Chiellini displays bite marks
 on his shoulder after the incident, but the referee wasn't swayed . So why do i
t? Any mental health professional will say it is a spontaneous act. Suarez did n
ot go into the match with Italy thinking he would bite Chiellini, given the chan
ce. It is also an opportunist crime, and born out of fear. Suarez has a history 
of biting, but usually when the game is not going well. He was murdering England
, and behaved impeccably, he was frustrated by Italy when the bronca overwhelmed
 him. This conforms to type. Suarez was getting little joy against Chelsea the d
ay he bit Branislav Ivanovic, and Liverpool were losing at the time. The Ajax ma
tch in which he bit Otman Bakkal of PSV Eindhoven in 2010 ended in a 0-0 draw. P
sychologists will also say Suarez bites when he feels threatened or is unnerved 
by circumstances. There is no record of an attack being perpetrated when his tea
m are winning, or even in a game in which he has already scored. Previous: Suare
z has a history of biting when the game isn't going his way . This excuses nothi
ng, of course, because what English football has found is that Suarez does not r
espond to patience, understanding and our most decent human emotions. He respond
s to a big stick. He had his greatest season in the last campaign for Liverpool,
 following a 10-match ban for biting Ivanovic. Yet in the loving arms of la cele
ste he goes unchallenged, unquestioned, unchecked. Uruguay are Suarez-dependent.
 They need him like an addict needs his fix. Nothing he does can be wrong. And S
uarez indulged is Suarez unhinged. That is why we are back here again. Cristiano
 Ronaldo has found it close to impossible to affect Portugal at this World Cup, 
yet Uruguay have been driven to eliminate England, and then Italy, by Suarez. He
 is the nearest in talent to Maradona here in his ability to singlehandedly driv
e a team. Angry: Branislav Ivanovic (left) was getting the better of Suarez duri
ng Chelsea's 2-2 draw with Liverpool . The return is that nothing he does can be
 wrong in their eyes. Uruguayâ€™s part in this Faustian pact is that they will d
efend the indefensible, endorse the ludicrous and feedÂ  paranoia, a perverse vi
ctim mentality, that is plainly unhealthy. Oscar Tabarez is a hugely respected c
oach on the South American continent, who even Maradona refers to as el maestro,
 yet he, too, was moved to foolishness by his refusal to acknowledge that Suarez
 had done wrong. Tabarez claimed the allegations were a conspiracy, conducted by
 people â€˜hiding in treesâ€™. That Suarezâ€™s act was beamed live across the wo
rld escaped him. Diego Lugano, Uruguayâ€™s captain, said Chiellini was a snitch 
and had shown the referee an old scar. Similar: Suarez (right) is the nearest in
 talent to Maradona in his ability to single-handedlyÂ  drive a team . Even thos
e from Uruguay who are here, ostensibly, as impartial observers failed to locate
 their critical faculties. There was no front-page controversy over Suarez in Ur
uguay and the website of the main football television network in the country, Te
nfield, carried instead a bizarre rant about Englandâ€™s controversial World Cup
 goal in 1966. There was no front-page controversy over Suarez in Uruguay and th
e website of the main football television network in the country, Tenfield, carr
ied instead a bizarre rant about Englandâ€™s controversial World Cup goal in 196
6. â€˜It would be good if these English people who are worried and are pushing t
o have Suarez suspended can explain how they won the World Cup in 1966 with a go
al that wasnâ€™t a goal, one that bounced in front of the goal-line after hittin
g the underside of the crossbar,â€™ said Tenfieldâ€™s correspondent, utilising l
ogic that could have explained Suarezâ€™s bite on Ivanovic away as a response to
 a tackle by Chopper Harris in 1968. Investigation: The Uruguay star looks conce
rned as he walks through the team hotel in Natal, Brazil . Sunderland manager Gu
s Poyet, a former Uruguay international with 26 caps, attempted to explain the d
ifferent cultures before the World Cup began by saying that where Suarez comes f
rom there is not such a strong ethical pressure around a sporting contest. â€˜I 
know that for you a handball on the goal-line is cheating,â€™ he said, â€˜but no
t for us. Itâ€™s part of the game. If Iâ€™m the last man and youâ€™re running an
d I pull your shirt and you go down and I get sent off â€” is that cheating? No,
 itâ€™s not cheating.â€™ Yet, around Suarez, such moral ambivalence can have dan
gerous consequences. The hangers-on and ego-fluffers amid his employers and advi
sers conspire to indulge Suarez the monster, while only the quiet men of the FAâ
€™s disciplinary arm have succeeded in controlling those animalistic excesses. G
oing? English football will be missed if he decides to leave Liverpool in the su
mmer . Everything he rails against in English football â€” the critics, the pres
s, those who decry a destructive attitude he confuses indulgently with desire â€
” are actually all that is good for him. Pandered to by his coach, his grateful 
team-mates and a slavish, cheerleading media, he is then set on a course of self
-destruction. That is the Suarez irony. He feels he punished England with the go
als that ended this countryâ€™s World Cup ambitions. He feels he was avenged. Ye
t avenged for what, exactly? Everything he despises about the English game is wh
at keeps him in check. If Suarez plays no further part in this World Cup, or in 
football for many months to come, it will be because he failed to learn the less
ons of his brief exposure to the standards of the English game. If only he knew 
it, weâ€™re the best friends he has.
