CANBERRA, Australia (AP) â€” A large shark was killed off the west Australian co
ast on Sunday, the first under a contentious new state government culling policy
 aimed at curbing fatal shark attacks. 
  
 The Western Australia government on Saturday began placing baited hooks on drum
 lines off popular beaches in the state capital Perth and to the south to kill w
hite, bull and tiger sharks over three meters (10 feet) long. 
  
 The policy is a response to seven fatal shark attacks in Australia's southwest 
in three years. 
  
 Government spokesman Simon Beaumont said the first shark was killed by a govern
ment-contracted commercial fisherman on Sunday morning off Castle Rock near the 
town of Dunsborough, 250 kilometers (155 miles) south of Perth. 
  
 The shark was longer than three meters (10 feet) and was one of the three targe
ted species. Beaumont would not say which of the three species it was. 
  
 Once the fisherman had confirmed with fishing authorities that the shark was th
e required species and size, he shot it and dumped the carcass at sea, Beaumont 
said. 
  
 The policy has divided the community since it was announced several weeks ago a
nd led to thousands of people demonstrating on Perth beaches against the shark c
ull. 
  
 Activists have threatened to sabotage the drum lines and threatened one fisherm
an who had accepted a government contract to catch sharks off Perth. He pulled o
ut, citing the threats. 
  
 The federal government last week gave state authorities a special exemption fro
m environmental laws to kill white sharks, a protected species. 
  
 Environmentalists argue that there is no evidence that the cull will reduce sha
rk attacks. They argue it could even increase the shark danger by giving water u
sers a false sense of security. 
  
 "To think that we're wasting this opportunity to tag and to find out more about
 these creatures, that we're just going to slaughter them and dump them â€” it's
 just such a waste of life," Rae Threnoworth, member of marine conservation grou
p Sea Shepherd, told Ten Network television. 
  
 State Premier Colin Barnett was heckled by members of the public over the shark
's death as he officiated at a citizenship ceremony in Perth on Sunday. 
  
 "I get no pleasure out of seeing sharks killed," Barnett told reporters. "But I
 have an overriding responsibility to protect the people of Western Australia. T
hat's what I'm doing." ||||| The first shark is caught under the drum line polic

 Premier Colin Barnett says he gets no pleasure at seeing sharks killed but his 
responsibility as Premier was the safety of beachgoers. 
  
 Speaking today after the first shark was caught and kill under the State Govern
ment's drum line policy, Mr Barnett said he was pleased the shark mitigation pla
n was underway and that it would reduce the risk to beachgoers. 
  
 The shark, which appeared to be a 3m tiger shark, was pulled from the water sho
rtly after 7am on a drum-line off Meelup Beach near Dunsborough. 
  
 It was shot in the head up to four times at close range. 
  
 Yesterday afternoon, amid pressure from the Government for the policy to come i
nto force in time for the Australia Day long weekend, several lines were set eit
her side of Dunsborough. 
  
 Despite fierce opposition and repeated claims of "direct action", environmental
 activists have not intervened. 
  
 The shark has been dumped off Cape Naturaliste. 
  
 The first of the baited hooks was set around Old Dunsborough beach at 2.25pm ye
sterday. 
  
 Mr Barnett said he was not surprised how quickly a shark was caught under the n
ew shark mitigation plan. 
  
 â€œThere are a lot of sharks down there,â€ he said. 
  
 â€œAnecdotal evidence is sufficiently strong that there has been a significant 
increase in the shark population and even more aggressive behaviour by sharks. 
  
 â€œUntil we can provide that protection and safety, the program will continue o
n." 
  
 Mr Barnett was heckled at a citizenship ceremony this morning where a person in
 the crowd yelled that "what you're doing with the sharks is wrong". 
  
 He appeared undeterred by recent protests about the shark policy. 
  
 â€œI respect and acknowledge and people have different points of view and there
 are protestors, but my responsibility as Premier is the safety of beachgoers,â€
 he said. 
  
 â€œI get no pleasure at seeing sharks killed but I have an overriding responsib
ility to protect the people of Western Australia and thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m doing.â
€ 
  
 â€œWhen you have sharks of three, four, five metres long of known aggressive va
rieties, swimming in the water very close to beachgoers, that is imminent danger
 and reluctantly I have had to take that decision.â€ 
  
 Under the policy, baited drum lines are to be set 1km off the coast in Perth an
d the South West to catch great white, tiger and bull sharks bigger than 3m in l
ength.

 Sea Shepherd's Jeff Hansen said the shark was â€œbelieved to be a beautiful tig
er sharkâ€ more than three metres long. 
  
 The fisherman contracted to catch and kill in the South West will also lay the 
lines at beaches in Meelup, Castle Rock and Gracetown. 
  
 Earlier yesterday, a document appeared on the Department of Transport website i
mplying metropolitan drum lines would also be in place by Monday.

 "Mariners are advised that a number of Government of Western Australia shark dr
um lines have been deployed within 1km offshore of the following metropolitan an
d regional areas and will remain in place until April 30,â€ it said. 
  
 The notice, due to be published in The West Australian on Monday, has since bee
n changed. 
  
 A spokesman acknowledged the error and said the wording had been corrected to i
nclude the words â€œwill soon be deployed in the metropolitan regionâ€. 
  
 "The fact remains, baited drum lines will be placed at popular metropolitan bea
ches as soon as possible, and mariners need to be advised there are exclusion zo
nes around these deployments,â€ he said.

 Labor spokeswoman Sue Ellery said it was another example of the Government botc
hing the implementation of the policy. 
  
 â€œAll they have done today is confuse mariners with the notice on the Departme
nt of Transport website,â€ she said. 
  
 â€œIf the lines are eventually ever actually dropped in the metropolitan area, 
how will metro boat users know which notice to believe?â€ 
  
 Conservationists are reportedly in Dunsborough today and are preparing to free 
any animals that are caught by the drum lines. 
  
 It is believed about 20 people from conservation group Animal Rescue Team are i
n the area with scuba diving equipment and an inflatable boat. 
  
 The Government yesterday announced the shark barrier designed to protect beachg
oers at Old Dunsborough beach had been completed. 
  
 The $165,000 barrier, based on those used on the Gold Coast to prevent bull sha
rk attacks, has been built as part of the City of Busseltonâ€™s beach enclosure 
trial. 
  
 The enclosure has six metal piles drilled into the seabed supporting a 100m x 3
00m mesh barrier. |||||
