he second presidential debate will be to woo back â€˜waitress momsâ€™ so crucial
 to his re-election, after a poll showed Mitt Romney has stole their votes in th
e first showdown and they are now neck and neck among women voters. According to
 a Gallup/USA Today poll of 12 swing states, Romney leads Obama by 12 points amo
ng men. But it is his surge among women voters to within one point of Obama that
 has given him a four-point overall lead that sets him on course to win the Whit
e House on November 6th. The poll, released on the eve of the second presidentia
l debate in Hempstead, New York, marks an apparent end to months of double-digit
 Obama leads over Romney among women and has plunged Democrats into panic mode. 
Debate prep: President Obama spent the weekend in Williamsburg, Virginia prepari
ng for the debate while Romney based his debate preparations at a Marriott in Bo
ston, Massachusetts . New format: Unlike the first debate, the second meeting wi
ll be in a 'town hall' format in which undecided voters will pose questions to t
he candidates . Unlike the first debate, the second meeting will be in a â€˜town
 hallâ€™ format in which undecided ordinary voters â€“ probably about a dozen â€
“ will pose questions. At least half of them are likely to be women. In addition
, the debate will be moderated by a woman - CNNâ€™s Candy Crowley. Democrats tra
ditionally enjoy a marked advantage among women. Bill Clintonâ€™s 1996 re-electi
on was said to have been based on winning over middle class, aspirational so-cal
led 'soccer moms'. But Obamaâ€™s popularity among females has plummeted after Ro
mneyâ€™s commanding debate performance in Denver nearly two weeks ago. Vice-Pres
ident Joe Biden's bullying display over Romney's running mate Paul Ryan also lef
t many women voters feeling alienated. Tied: Mitt Romney is now neck and neck wi
th President Obama among women voters, according to a new Gallup survey . Within
 an hour of the Gallup survey being released, the Obama campaign â€“ which recen
tly mocked Republicans for questioning poll methodology, went on the offensive a
gainst the 75-year-old polling firm. Reporters were sent a memo from Obama polls
ter Joel Benenson. In it, he said: â€˜'The latest Gallup/USA Today Battleground 
survey showing President Obama and Governor Romney tied with women in battlegrou
nd states (48-48) is an extreme outlier, defying the trends seen in every other 
battleground and national poll,' said Benenson. Overall, Romney has 50 per cent 
of support among likely voters in the 12 battleground states, while Obama is tra
iling with 46 per cent support, according to the survey. Without winning women, 
Obama's path to victory in November is complicated, if not impossible. The memo 
includes a chart of selected surveys from a handful of battleground states that 
give Obama a 10-point lead over Romney among women nationally.Â  'This implausib
le result among women appears to not even provide an accurate reflection on the 
electorate today, making its value questionable,' Benenson insisted. Women tend 
to start paying close attention to election campaigns later and are more open to
 persuasion than men. This makes female voters, particularly the blue-collar â€˜
waitress momsâ€™ whose families have been hard-hit by the recession and unemploy
ment, the most-prized group of swing voters in 2012. Fighting for women: Female 
voters, particularly the blue-collar . â€˜waitress momsâ€™ whose families have b
een hard-hit by the recession and . unemployment, are the most-prized group of s
wing voters in 2012 . Celinda Lake, a veteran Democratic . pollster, told â€˜USA
 Todayâ€™: â€˜In every poll, we've seen a major surge . among women in favourabi
lity for Romneyâ€™ since the Denver debate. â€˜Women . went into the debate acti
vely disliking Romney, and they came out . thinking he might understand their li
ves and might be able to get . something done for them.â€™ Unlike the first pres
idential debate, tonight's debate will be in a 'town hall' format, meaning candi
dates will answer questions from members of an audience, rather than a moderator
. There are 80 audience members total, which were selected by Gallup from a samp
le of undecided voters who live near the debate's location in Hempstead on Long 
Island. The participants had to submit their questions ahead of time. The debate
 moderator, CNN's Candy Crowley, will decide who to call on during the debate ba
sed on her reviews of their submitted questions. The candidates will have two mi
nutes to respond to each question, after which the moderator can ask a follow-up
 question of her choosing. The candidates will have one minute to respond to the
 moderator's question. The 'town hall' format is designed to be more relaxed and
 conversational, with the candidates free to walk around the forum instead of re
maining confined behind a podium or a desk. But the format also lends itself to 
more opportunities for unplanned or candid events, such as the 1992 debate where
 President Bush was caught on camera checking his watch. She . added that while 
Obama currently maintains an edge among women voters, . the changed views of Rom
ney could be â€˜a precursor to movementâ€™ in . greater numbers towards the Repu
blican nominee. â€˜It opens them up to . take a second look, and that's the dang
er for Obama.' Democrats were scrambling Monday to maintain their historical edg
e among female voters. Party officials held a conference call in an effort to ra
ise alarm over how a Republican administration would impact women's lives negati
vely and the . progressive group MoveOn.org released an ad starring three Hollyw
ood . actresses who claimed Republicans would try to end abortion rights for . w
omen. The . Romney campaign, on the other hand, touted the survey's findings as 
. proof that women are increasingly concerned about the economy instead of . iss
ues like birth control. Republicans said the survey shows women feel . Romney is
 better equipped than Obama to spur economic growth. Romney's path to winning a 
greater share of the female voting bloc has been long and arduous. He . trailed 
the president by 18 percentage points among female voters in a . Gallup survey f
rom April, around the time that Democrats were attacking . Republicans for 'wagi
ng a war on women' by supporting legislation that . would limit insurance covera
ge for contraceptives. That's when Romney's advisers decided to . step up the vi
sibility of his wife, Ann, on the campaign trail to try . and make Romney more r
elatable as a husband and a father. Wooing women: First Lady Michelle Obama and 
Romney's wife, Ann, have been helping their husbands appeal to women on the camp
aign trail . The campaign also organized 'Women for . Romney' grassroots groups 
in battleground states across the country and . began cutting dozens of televisi
on ads that featured clips of Ann . talking about Mr Romney's 'softer' side. The
 strategy has helped Romney slowly . chip away at Obama's lead among female vote
rs and after the president's . decidedly lackluster debate performance earlier t
his month, Romney . appears to be finally closing the gender gap. As Romney look
s to maintain the progress . he's made among female voters, he's likely to tread
 lightly on topics . such as abortion and birth control during tonight's debate 
-- and to . pivot back to the economy whenever possible. Introducing Ann: Romney
's advisers decided to step up the . visibility of his wife, Ann, on the campaig
n trail to try and make . Romney more relatable as a husband and a father . In t
he lead: Overall, Romney has 50 per cent of support among likely voters in 12 ba
ttleground states, while Obama is trailing with 46 per cent support, according t
o the Gallup survey . High stakes: President Obama's supporters are hoping for a
 stronger performance from their candidate in Tuesday's debate after his lacklus
ter first performance . President Obama, on the other hand, will be looking for 
every opportunity to remind female voters of the measures he has enacted while i
n office that target women, such as the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. He will als
o be looking for every chance to remind women that that he was raised by a singl
e mom and that he is the father of two daughters.
