Thomas Cook Airlines will operate a weekly flight between Glasgow and the Americ
an city next summer.
The airline said it was introducing the service following a series of one-off fl
ights to the US in recent summers.
It will operate between 4 May and 31 October next year, using the airline's Airb
us A330 fleet.
Christoph Debus, chief executive of Thomas Cook Airlines, said: "It's fantastic 
news that we are able to start a regular flight to Las Vegas next summer as a re
sult of the great support and feedback we've received when we've operated indivi
dual flights to the US.
"It's great news for holidaymakers, too, that they now have even more choice whe
n looking for long-haul flights from Glasgow to this increasingly popular destin
ation."
Glasgow Airport welcomed news of the new route.
Commercial director Francois Bourienne said: "Las Vegas attracts tens of million
s of visitors every year and this will be the first time Scotland will have had 
a regular service to what is often referred to as the entertainment capital of t
he world.
"Not only is Thomas Cook's decision to introduce a weekly service to Las Vegas f
or the duration of the 2015 summer season excellent news for Glasgow Airport and
 our customers, it further strengthens our already extensive long-haul offering.
"
The airline has also announced an additional flight to Tunisia with flights avai
lable three times a week in the summer of 2015.
