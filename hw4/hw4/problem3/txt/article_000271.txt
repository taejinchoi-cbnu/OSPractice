By . James Slack for the Daily Mail . Foreign criminals have been rounded up fro
m Britainâ€™s â€˜softâ€™ open jails and put back behind bars to stop them abscon
ding. Over the past 48 hours, more than 20 offenders were moved back to closed c
onditions. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has now imposed a ban on foreign con
victs who are subject to deportation orders being placed in open jail. More than
 20 offenders were moved from open jails and back to closed conditions to stop t
hem absconding . They will also be barred from taking part in Release on Tempora
ry Licence, whereby inmates can leave a jail in the daytime to find work or unde
rgo rehabilitation because a string of prisoners have failed to return. The move
 will affect hundreds of foreign prisoners. There are some 800 awaiting deportat
ion. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: â€˜We are working hard to return for
eign national prisoners to their own countries to serve their sentences. While t
hey remain with us, we must do all we can to make sure they stay safely under lo
ck and key. â€˜Thatâ€™s why I am changing the rules to prevent those foreign nat
ionals who are going to be deported from being transferred into open prisons or 
getting temporary release. â€˜Itâ€™s clearly not right that foreign nationals wh
o are going to be deported end up in open prisons where they might abscond and t
hreaten public safety.â€™ Figures published last month showed a sharp rise in th
e number of inmates going missing from jail â€“ in the past year there were 225,
 up almost 30 per cent over the past two years. This included 137 from open pris
ons, which have been the subject of controversy after a spate of criminals walke
d out. The most high-profile was Michael Wheatley, known as the â€˜Skullcrackerâ
€™, who sparked a nationwide hunt after absconding from HMP Standford Hill on th
e Isle of Sheppey, Kent. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling (pictured) has imposed
 ban on foreign convicts subject to deportation orders . Officials say the numbe
r of foreign criminals who have walked out is around 10 over the past five years
. It comes amid renewed controversy over the Governmentâ€™s record. On Monday, t
he Mail revealed how the number of overseas inmates escaping deportation rockete
d by 50 per cent last year. In total, only 1,310 of the 4,030 overseas convicts 
considered for removal were sent home. The offenders who were not thrown out las
t year included 15 murderers, five people guilty of manslaughter, 15 rapists, 14
0 robbers and 20 people guilty of sex offences against children. The foreign con
victs are now avoiding deportation in one in every three cases â€“ a sharp incre
ase on previous years.
