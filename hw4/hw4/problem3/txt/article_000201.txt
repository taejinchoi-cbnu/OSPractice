There was never any question over what Claire Rumble would call her daughter whe
n she was born last month. It was always going to be Rosie, the name of the spec
ialist nurse who looked after her big brother Louis during his three-and-half ye
ar battle with leukaemia. 'Deciding on the name was easy,' explains Claire. 'My 
husband James and I have never met anyone like Rosie â€” it was a tiny gesture o
f thanks for everything sheâ€™s done.' Three months earlier, five-year-old Louis
 had finally finished his treatment and was declared cancer-free. Heroic: Nurse 
Rosie Chisnell (right) has been nominated for a Health Hero Award by Claire Rumb
le (left) But it was the empathy and the many extra hours Rosie Chisnell put in 
helping the anxious family along their journey that has earned her a nomination 
for the Daily Mail Health Hero award. 'Other nurses clock in and off, Rosie is a
 constant. Thereâ€™s no one else like her,' says Claire, a 34-year-old accountan
t. The family, who live in Hemel Hempstead, in Hertfordshire, first met Rosie in
 September 2009,Â  after a terrifying five days when Louis became suddenly and d
esperately ill. 'One day he was fine, playing with his twin sister Grace, then s
uddenly he stopped eating, was pale, exhausted and crying through the night for 
no apparent reason,' recalls Claire. 'When angry purple bruises appeared all ove
r his body we rushed him to hospital.'' Just 12 hours after a barrage of tests a
t Watford General Hospital doctors revealed the shocking diagnosis: the 19-month
-old had leukaemia. 'You canâ€™t imagineÂ  what being told your son has cancer f
eels like,' says Claire. 'The world just stops.' As the hospitalâ€™s paediatric 
oncology nurse, Rosie, 56, was there at the diagnosis. 'For the next two hours R
osie sat with us explaining everything in great depth, fielding our questions an
d laying everything out clearly and honestly. 'I remember asking her whether Lou
is was going to die and she said: "His condition is fully treatable." She couldn
â€™t say no, but she has a natural way of reassuring you. It wasnâ€™t until late
r that I realised her shift had actually finished at 5pm, six hours earlier. She
â€™d stayed to help us.' It was just the first of many such gestures that demons
trated Rosieâ€™s extraordinary dedication to her young patients. 'Rosie would of
ten call us at 9pm, hours after she should have left, with Louisâ€™s blood resul
ts. Weâ€™d say: "What are you doing, go home," but sheâ€™d just laugh and sayÂ  
she had a list of patients she needed to call.' Tragic: Cancer takes a particula
rly grim toll on children who find chemotherapy extremely hard . Support: Sick c
hildren, such as this little girl at Great Ormond Street hospital, need extra ca
re . From day one the Rumble family had her mobile number. 'Children arenâ€™t il
l nine to five, Monday to Friday,' explains Rosie. 'I would hate to think someth
ing might happen and a family couldnâ€™t get hold of me.' Claire and James, a 37
-year-old aircraft engineer, frequently had to call Rosie late at night when Lou
is developed croup â€” a fierce barking cough â€” because of his weak immune sys
tem. 'Iâ€™d be beside myself, worrying whether he needed to be rushed into hospi
tal or not. Knowing she was there, a phone call away, was a huge emotional suppo
rt and stopped me flying into a blind panic.' Once Louis accidentally pulled out
 his nasogastric tube â€” a tube inserted via the nose into the stomach to admin
ister medication. Unfortunately, it was on a weekend when Rosie wasnâ€™t working
, but she knew putting it back would be a traumatic experience for a child, so d
ropped everything and drove the 40 minutes from home to the hospital to do the p
rocedure herself. 'I just couldnâ€™t believe it. You donâ€™t expect a nurse to d
o things like that, especially on their weekend off,' says Claire. 'We knew we h
ad someone special in our corner.' In February 2010, Louis developed an infectio
n which meant he had to go to hospital twice a day for antibiotic treatment unti
l it cleared. For a child so young, it was a horrible experience: 'Iâ€™d lift hi
m, asleep, from his cot and heâ€™d start crying pleading: â€˜No go, Mummy, no go
.â€™ It was heart breaking.' The next day Rosie called to say not to take Louis 
to hospital as she was coming to their house with the equipment to teach Claire 
how to administer the intravenous antibiotics at home. 'I couldnâ€™t believe any
one could be so kind. She arrived with a great crate of equipment and stayed unt
il almost midnight, showing me exactly how it all worked; the pump, the syringes
, everything. 'Louisâ€™s face lights up when he sees her and when he was in hosp
ital if he heard her heels click-clacking down the corridor he would sit up in b
ed. 'Sheâ€™d chase him around the ward on hands and knees, despite her dress and
 heels (she doesnâ€™t â€˜doâ€™ trousers) and treat him with such care and affect
ion, explaining everything so he wouldnâ€™t be scared. Health Hero: Do you know

 'Postman Pat would always be put on the TV when she was taking blood samples an
d sheâ€™d administer a bowl of Cheerios, another favourite, if he wasnâ€™t eatin
g. 'Whatever Rosie said, Louis would do. Grace, as his twin, could have felt lef
t out but Rosie included her in everything, even letting her occasionally stay o
vernight in hospital with him as a sleepover. 'For a parent, you canâ€™t underes
timate the impact of having someone like Rosie around. Iâ€™d have spent days ste
wing over Louisâ€™s health, endlessly worrying, but Rosie being just a phone cal
l away meant I was less anxious and felt more in control. She helped me and Jame
s to focus on the practicalities of his treatment and be better parents.' So wha
t drives this kind of dedication? 'Itâ€™s the children,' Rosie explains. 'Theyâ€
™re a model to us all. They just get on with it, the good and the bad. If I can 
improve their lives, or their families, even a bit, Iâ€™m happy. 'I know in this
 job I can make a difference. Iâ€™ve always loved children and got on with them 
easily and even as a little girl knew I wanted to be a nurse.' Rosie, who is mar
ried to Ian, a solicitor, never had children of her own, a conscious decision be
cause of her career. 'Ian and I both work very hard. Iâ€™ve trained and worked i
n healthcare, specialising in paediatrics since I was 19. I have a wonderful nie
ce, two nephews and lots of children at the hospital to keepÂ  me busy.' Rosie i
s adamant that she wouldnâ€™t be able to provide such high standards of care wit
hout the help of her colleagues. 'I couldnâ€™t be nearly so flexible without a s
trong team behind me.' One member of that team is Vasanta Nanduri, a consultant 
paediatric oncologist who has worked with Rosie for the last 18 years. She says:
 'Sheâ€™s my right hand, a great friend with far too much energy and someone I t
rust implicitly. 'But itâ€™s her knowledge and dedication to the children which 
is so impressive. She works out of hours, late into the night. She rarely takes 
a holiday, even though we try to make her. If she does, she writes 50-page hando
ver notes. Sheâ€™s a real inspiration. Everyone on the ward looks up to her.' Se
ntiments echoed by Claire. 'It will be a sad day when Rosie retires and I feel s
orry for the families who wonâ€™t get to meet her. We felt lucky every day that 
she was around and now weâ€™ll always be reminded of her kindness by baby Rosie.
