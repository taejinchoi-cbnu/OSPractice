Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Inter
net Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine a
fter an embargo period. ||||| Ever wonder who's more stupid: Justin Bieber's fol
lowers or Ashton Kutcher's? Well, wonder no more â€” there's a new app in town t
hat will gauge Twitter idiocy for you. 
  
  
  
 Tom Scott, of Tweleted fame, has come out with a new website called Stupid Figh
t that measures the mental capacity of someone's Twitter followers by sifting th
rough the last 100 people to @ reply to the person in question. According to the
 site's FAQs: 
  
 "It estimates based on several stupid indicators. Are they using twenty exclama
tion marks in a row? Do they endlessly use the abbreviation 'OMG'? Do they seem 
incapable of working out where their Shift key is? These indicators have a stron
g correlation with the message, and its sender, being stupid." 
  
 Scott hypes the site as a way to determine how stupid the followers of celebs a
re, but it works just as well with your personal Twitter account. We pit Bieber 
and Kutcher against each other below as a test. Seeing as how "Justin Bieber" is
 an extremely popular trending topic, the results are actually quite worrisome.
