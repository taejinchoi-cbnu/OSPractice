ust, and Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon. Queen Elizabeth II smiles at sch

 during the summer and early Autumn of 1940. The monarch and Duke then met trust
ees, supporters and volunteers before meeting local school children learning abo
ut the Battle of Britain in the dedicated education area, The Geoffrey Page Cent
re. The Queen and The Duke also visited the 'Cockpit CafÃ©', where they met a gr
