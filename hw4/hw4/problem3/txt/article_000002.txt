This was, Sergio Garcia conceded, much like being hunted by Tiger, complete with
 the roars thatÂ  provided the first sign of danger. Only this time here it was 
Rory McIlroy who was terrorising the two golfers ahead of him. McIlroy who was d
rawing deafening applause from the crowds in the group behind. For Garcia and Ri
ckie Fowler, it made the final few holes of a dramatic third round here in Hoyla
ke all the more torturous. As Fowler dropped a shot on 17, his third bogey in fo
ur holes, McIlroy could be heard making eagle on the adjacent 16th. Under pressu
re: Sergio Garcia and Rickie Fowler during the third round on Saturday . As the 
American and the Spaniard then made their way across the third fairway to the sc
orer's tent, there came another roar for yet another eagle on 18 for the Ulsterm
an. Fowler had just birdied 18 but even that failed to stop the gap between firs
t and second widening. Defending champion Phil Mickelson felt he missed a good o
pportunity to move up the leaderboard on day three. Mickelson was among the day'
s first starters, teeing off at 9am, but failed to take advantage of unexpectedl
y good conditions. The lefthander fired a 71 to lie 15 shots behind leader Rory 
McIlroy overnight and said: 'We had beautiful scoring conditions, first group of
f. If we could have shot seven, eight, nine under par it probably was out there.
 It was as easy as I've seen the course play. We could have made some noise. 'It
 could have been a lot lower and I let a lot of shots slide.' Mickelson, who cam
e through the field to win with a final-round 66 at Muirfield last year, opened 
here with rounds of 74 and 70. Garcia admitted afterwards that playing McIlroy i
n this kind of form is as daunting as waging war against Woods in his prime; an 
almost futile exercise however well those inÂ  the chasing pack might be playing
. 'I don't think Rory has been as consistent as Tiger was for so many years, but
 when he's at his best he's right up there,' said Garcia. 'Obviously I heard the
 roar on 16. I didn't know but I imagined it was an eagle. The only thing you ca
n do is say "well done".' For Fowler is proved particularly galling. He was tear
ing up this course in near perfect conditions, going through the turn in 32Â  an
d then birdying 10, 11 and 12Â  to erase the six-shot advantage McIlroy had take
n into the third round. But then came that crushing run of bogies and with it an
 emphatic McIlroy response. Fowler will nevertheless take encouragement from the
 fact that the six-shot lead McIlroy now has this afternoon can be closed, becau
se he did it in 12 holes yesterday. He can also draw some comfort in knowing his
 two professional wins to date were both achieved with McIlroy as runner-up. His
 first victory, the Wells Fargo Championship two years ago, came after beating M
cIlroy on the first extra hole of a sudden-death play-off. Add to that the benef
it of having been in much the same position in the US Open last month, not toÂ  
mention the confidence of having already finished in the top five in both majors
 this year, and Fowler goes into the final pairing today in decent shape. Feel t
he force: Rickie Fowler tees off on the 13th hole at Hoylake on Saturday . The a
dvice he gets from Phil Mickleson, someone he referred to affectionately as his 
golf 'dad', is also sure to come in handy. What better mentor to have than last 
year's Open champion? 'I've learned a lot from Phil,' said Fowler. 'He's kind of
 been like, I hate to say it, but like a dad out here. It's been a lot of fun be
ing around him. Not just playing on Tuesday, but having dinner with him andÂ  se
eing how he operates on and off the golf course.' Thanks to the work he has been
 doing this past year with ButchÂ  Harmon â€“ a coach Fowler described as the 'b
est in the world' â€“ the young American has beenÂ  itting his irons superbly an
d at times he putted beautifully too,Â  sinking one from around 30 feet on the s
econd hole. Garcia's approach on the eighth was also worthy of mention, even if 
he will want toÂ  forget the two-and-a-half foot putt he missed on 12. Garcia th
inks it a tall order, catching McIlroy. 'If he shoots three under, I have to sho
ot 10,' he said with a smile. 'So if Rory plays the way he's been playing it's d
ifficult to see anybody catching him. When Rory plays well every course suits hi
m. There's not really a lot of weaknesses in his game.' In the swing: American R
ickie Fowler has been hitting his irons superbly . Fowler knows that too, having
 grown up competing againstÂ  McIlroy. They are just a few months apart in age â
€“ now both 25 â€“ and are actually good friends as well as neighbours in Jupite
r, Florida. They also have a penchant for brightly covered clothing even if McIl
roy joked this week thatÂ  Fowler's fashion sense â€“ he will once again wear th
e orange of Olklahoma State University today â€“ was highly questionable. 'We've
 travelled a bit together between tournaments,' said Fowler. 'We first played ag
ainst each other at the Walker Cup in 2007 and it's kind of gone from there. So 
I'mÂ  looking forward to it tomorrow. It's going to be a good time. We're good b
uddies and at the same time we both want to beat up on each other as bad as poss
ible. 'If I can go out and put a bit of pressure on him and make him earn it a b
it, get myself in the mix, maybe we'll be able to throw some blows back and fort
h. 'The US Open last month was my first time in the final group at a major. But 
it was just a matter of time before the two of us found a way to sneak into a fi
nal group together.'
