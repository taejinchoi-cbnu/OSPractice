Rome, Italy (CNN) -- Two Pakistani men accused of providing logistical support f
or last year's deadly terror attacks in Mumbai, India,  were arrested Saturday i
n Italy, police said. They were arrested in the northern Italian city of Brescia
, said Stefano Fonzi, head of Italy's Division of General Investigations and Spe
cial Operations. The attacks on India's largest city lasted four days. The attac
kers targeted several sites in Mumbai, taking over several hotels and a Jewish c
enter. The attacks left 160 people dead. On November 25, 2008, the day before th
e attacks in Mumbai, the two men arrested allegedly transferred $229 that was us
ed to activate Internet phone lines used by the suspects. Two others connected w
ith the longstanding money transfer agency in Brescia also were arrested for oth
er illegal activity, Fonzi told CNN. Police are looking for a fifth man. Italian
 police started their investigation the following month after being alerted by I
ndian authorities and the FBI that funds had been transferred from Italy, Fonzi 
said. Authorities suspected the agency after money was transferred under the Mus
lim name of a man who had never entered Italy, a police statement said. Indian p
olice have said 10 Pakistanis were involved in the deadly assault, nine of whom 
were killed in the carnage. The lone surviving suspect has linked the coordinate
d shooting and bombing incidents to the leader of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-T
ayyiba, a militant group that is banned in India. CNN's Hada Messia in Rome cont
ributed to this report.
