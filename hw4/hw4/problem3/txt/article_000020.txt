She did it ‚Äì and this time, that‚Äôs a good thing. 
  
 Lindsay Lohan worked like crazy and completed 115 hours of community service in
 Brooklyn to meet her Thursday deadline and avoid jail, a source confirmed to th
e Daily News. 
  
 ‚ÄúShe finished last night or today,‚Äù the well-placed source said Wednesday. 
  
 And while the prosecutor on her case contested a prior batch of hours served ov
erseas in London, Santa Monica City Attorney Terry White said Wednesday that he 
plans to accept the new Brooklyn hours when they‚Äôre presented at a Los Angeles
 hearing Thursday morning. 
  
 ‚ÄúIt does appear that Ms. Lohan has completed her community service hours, and
 at this point I am not anticipating any sort of challenge to the hours,‚Äù Whit
e told The News Wednesday.

 It was three weeks ago on May 7 that a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge 
said Lohan could race to Brooklyn from her new home in London and try to complet
e 115 hours of service with the charity group Brooklyn Community Services (BCS) 
by a May 28 deadline. 
  
 He warned that the deadline was firm, and jail was on the table.

 ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs had three years to take care of this. If it‚Äôs not done by May 28, 
there will be consequences,‚Äù Judge Mark A. Young said.

 Lohan, 28, got off to a rocky start, missing her first day at BCS‚Äôs Duffield 
Children‚Äôs Center in Fort Greene on May 12. But she started the next morning a
nd powered through back-to-back full-day shifts at the daycare center, a women‚Ä
ôs shelter in East New York and possibly other BCS groups. 
  
 Her lawyer Shawn Holley is expected to appear on her behalf and submit the proo
f of service Thursday. 
  
 If the judge signs off, Lohan could wrap up her 2012 reckless driving case and 
be off probation for the first time since her conviction for back-to-back DUIs i
n 2007. 
  
 The ‚ÄúMean Girls‚Äù actress originally was ordered to complete 240 hours of co
mmunity service by last November to satisfy probation for her June 2012 car cras
h on the Pacific Coast Highway in Santa Monica. 
  
 She scored an extension when a judge agreed to give her more time as she acted 
in a London production of the David Mamet play ‚ÄúSpeed the Plow" late last year
.

 Lohan later rushed to meet the extended deadline in January and thought she mad
e the cut until prosecutors objected. 
  
 White questioned how Lohan was able to complete 10 hours on Jan. 19 considering
 she went to an emergency room that day for treatment of a mosquito-borne virus 
she purportedly picked up in Bora Bora. 
  
 ‚Äú(A) note says she received acute care for three days, but on those three day
s, again, 10 hours were served,‚Äù he said with exasperation in late January. 
  
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm having trouble not only with the quality of the work but whether or no
t the work was actually done,‚Äù he told the judge. 
  
 She agreed to serve 125 hours by May 28 to settle the dispute and had 115 to go
 as of her last hearing. 
  
 Lohan‚Äôs service with BCS appeared to go well with parents offering their supp
ort and the former child star keeping a low profile.
