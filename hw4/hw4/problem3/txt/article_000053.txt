This week, the U.S. Navy forsook a tradition dating back to the 1800s. Why? Beca
use it's now too easily confused with the musings of an Internet lunatic. Naval 
commanders this week announced that they would be getting rid of a rule that all
 official communications should be in all-caps. It's a tradition dating to the 1
850s, when the military used teletype machines that didn't have lowercase letter
s. The change is meant to simplify communication and is supposed to save the Nav
y $15 million because it can get rid of a dedicated messaging service and use re
gular old e-mail instead. But we have to think not wanting to sound like you're 
shouting at someone who SAID SOMETHING WRONG ON THE INTERNET played a role, too.
 The most gentle message can come across as psychotically aggressive when typed 
in all caps. So as the Navy transitions, we decided to round up five of our favo
rite examples of all-cap craziness. The Kanye mea culpa . Perhaps it's not a ran
t, as such. (Though he's certainly been no stranger to them). But we had to go w
ith the time Kanye West slammed down the caps lock to apologize, on his blog, fo
r his infamous stage-bombing of Taylor Swift at the 2009 Video Music Awards. "I'
M SOOOOO SORRY TO TAYLOR SWIFT AND HER FANS AND HER MOM. I SPOKE TO HER MOTHER R
IGHT AFTER AND SHE SAID THE SAME THING MY MOTHER WOULD'VE SAID. SHE IS VERY TALE
NTED! I LIKE THE LYRICS ABOUT BEING A CHEERLEADER AND SHE'S IN THE BLEACHERS! ..
...................... I'M IN THE WRONG FOR GOING ON STAGE AND TAKING AWAY FROM 
HER MOMENT!................." Of course, in the grand tradition of half-apologie
s, he spends several of his remaining loud sentences justifying the moment he in
terrupted Swift's acceptance speech to say that Beyonce should have won instead 
of her. "BEYONCE'S VIDEO WAS THE BEST OF THIS DECADE!!!! I... WELCOME TO THE REA
L WORLD!!!! EVERYBODY WANNA BOOOOO ME BUT I'M A FAN OF REAL POP CULTURE!!! ... I
'M STILL HAPPY FOR TAYLOR!!!! BOOOYAAAWWWW!!!! YOU ARE VERY VERY TALENTED!!! ...
  I'M NOT CRAZY YALL, I'M JUST REAL." Gotcha. The Bakery flame-out . Having your
 restaurant appear on "Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares" is bad enough. Having
 the host quit on you because you're too hard to work with is even worse. Flamin
g out about it on Facebook in a series of profanity-laced all-caps outbursts? Pr
iceless. Amy's Baking Company, in Scottsdale, Arizona, experienced just that las
t month after appearing on the show with the famously acerbic chef. So, after th
e show aired, the smart thing to do would be to take to social media to calmly e
xplain how your restaurant was misrepresented, right? Or, you can try this: . "W
E DO NOT NEED THIS. YOU STUPID PEOPLE. ... DO NOT BLAME US BECAUSE YOU CAN NOT A
FFORD QUALITY. THE YELPERS, AND NOW THE REDDITS, NEED TO BACK OFF. YOURE NOT RIG
HT BECAUSE OF SOME TV SHOW." A Facebook freakout? Wrong you are, apparently: . "
WE ARE NOT FREAKING OUT WE DO NOT CARE ABOUT A 'WITCH HUNT' I AM NOT A WITCH. I 
AM GODS CHILD. P--- OFF ALL OF YOU. F--- REDDITS, F--- YELP AND F--- ALL OF YOU.
 BRING IT. WE WILL FIGHT BACK." Believe us when we tell you they were just getti
ng started. Things got so bad that Amy's has since created a new Facebook page. 
Nearly a month later, let's just say that it's still not polite coffee talk. The
 Comic Sans LeBron slam . Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert's 2010 open lett
er to fans after LeBron James left the team for the shores of South Beach is mai
nly remembered for another typographical choice. His fiery screed was typed in C
omic Sans -- an Internet-reviled font that is sort of hard to read without giggl
ing. But it was the single sentence he decided to go all-caps with that makes th
is list: . "I PERSONALLY GUARANTEE THAT THE CLEVELAND CAVALIERS WILL WIN AN NBA 
CHAMPIONSHIP BEFORE THE SELF-TITLED FORMER 'KING' WINS ONE" As you NBA fans may 
have noted, James already has one title under his belt with the Miami Heat and h
e's currently in the finals playing for number two. The Cavs? Still waiting. I'l
l tweet you, babe . OK, Cher, we get it. Donald Trump rubs a lot of people the w
rong way. From the tone-deaf self-promotion to the strident political views, Mr.
 Apprentice has mixed it up with everyone from irreverent sports blog Deadspin t
o CNN's own Wolf Blitzer. So when the pop-music icon caught on to an effort to b
oycott Trump's line of neckties, she was so worked up she had to do it in all-ca
ps. "I'll NEVER GO TO MACY'S AGAIN! I didn't know they sold Donald Trump's Line!
 If they don't care that they sell products from a LOUDMOUTH," Cher wrote on Twi
tter. Then:  "RACIST CRETIN,WHO'D LIE LIKE 'HIS RUG' TO GET SOME CHEAP PRESS! I 
CANT BELIEVE MACY'S THINKS HE'S THE RIGHT 'MAN' 2 REPRESENT THEIR NAME!" Say wha
t you will about The Donald. At least he didn't resort to all-caps in his respon
se. "@cher should spend more time focusing on her family and dying career!" Trum
p wrote. We didn't say it was classy. Just that it wasn't in all-caps. Drunk Hul
k Is drunk . OK, we didn't say they were the worst all-caps rants. Just the top 
ones. And it's hard to top an enormous green rage monster who has knocked back a
 few too many. Twitter's Drunk Hulk, one of our favorite parody accounts, tweets
 sort of exactly like you'd imagine a witty, pre-intervention Hulk would tackle 
the topics of the day. On government surveillance: "IT GREAT GOVERNMENT RECORD E
VERY PHONE CALL! NOW DRUNK HULK FIND OUT WHAT WAS SAID WHEN DRUNK HULK CALL YOU 
LAST NIGHT!" On really sad fantasy epics: "GAME OF THRONES! GO TO YOUR ROOM! AND
 THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU DONE!" On a Billy Joel classic: "IF YOU SEE MAN MAKING LOV
E TO TONIC AND GIN AT BAR! NO SING SONG ABOUT IT! CALL POLICE IMMEDIATELY!" His 
whole Twitter feed is an all-caps rant. And we're not going to tell him to stop,
 are you? What did we miss? Let us know about some of your favorite rants in the
 comments.
