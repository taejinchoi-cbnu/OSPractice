The Irish News goes big on a claim that five Orange Halls have been awarded gran
ts under a controversial Stormont scheme after applying as cultural, educational
 or historical societies.

The scheme has been criticised by nationalists after it emerged that dozens of l
oyal order and band halls were offered grants of up to Â£25,000.
Last week, the Irish News reported the department had also promised Â£25,000 t
