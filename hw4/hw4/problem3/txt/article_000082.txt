A new project seeks to kickstart a revival for the worldâ€™s largest rainforest 
by planting new trees â€” tens of millions of them. 
  
 The project, announced Friday at the â€œRock in Rioâ€ music fest in Brazil, ai
ms to restore 73 million trees in the Brazilian Amazon by 2023. Spanning 30,000 
hectares of land (about 74,000 acres), the project is the largest tropical fores
t restoration in the world and helps Brazil move towards its Paris Agreement tar
get of reforesting 12 million hectares of land by 2030. 
  
 â€œThis is a breathtakingly audacious project,â€ said M. Sanjayan, CEO of Cons
ervation International (CI), one of the partners behind the effort. â€œThe fate 
of the Amazon depends on getting this right â€” as do the regionâ€™s 25 million 
residents, its countless species and the climate of our planet.â€ 
  
 The Amazon forest is home to the richest biodiversity of any ecosystem on the p
lanet â€” a recent report described some 400 new species discovered in the Amazo
n between 2014 and 2015 alone â€” yet is rapidly vanishing with increasing globa
l demand for resources. The economy, essentially focused on the exploitation of 
natural resources, minerals and agribusiness, has already led to about 20 percen
t of original forest cover to be replaced by pastures and agricultural crops, wi
thout securing the well-being of the local population. The reforestation project
 fills an urgent need to develop the regionâ€™s economy without destroying its f
orests and ensuring the well-being of its people.

 â€œA new chapter is being written for the Brazilian Amazon with this initiative
,â€ said Rodrigo Medeiros, vice president of CIâ€™s Brazil office. â€œProtectin
g the Amazon is not something we should think in the future â€” we have to do it
 now.â€ 
  
 The project is a partnership between Conservation International, the Brazilian 
Ministry of Environment, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the World Bank, 
the Brazilian Biodiversity Fund (Funbio) and Rock in Rioâ€™s environmental arm â
€œAmazonia Live.â€ 
  
 The reforestation effort is part of a broader regional initiative, the Amazonia
 Sustainable Landscapes Project. This project aims to increase the area of fores
t ecosystems, promote the connectivity of protected areas within the Amazon, and
 further develop local productive activities and value chains derived from the s
ustainable use of Amazonian biodiversity, including production of native species
 of seeds and seedlings. 
  
 Priority areas for the restoration effort include southern Amazonas, RondÃ´nia,
 Acre, ParÃ¡ and the Xingu watershed. Restoration activities will include the en
richment of existing secondary forest areas, sowing of selected native species, 
and, when necessary, direct planting of native species, Medeiros said.

 Further reading ||||| There are more habitable planets in our galaxy than human
s living on planet Earth. But the nearest one is about 70 trillion miles away , 
which means that, for now, and for the foreseeable future, Earth is the only lif
e-supporting rock hurtling through infinite space weâ€™ll ever know. Itâ€™s real
ly not the best idea to let it burn upâ€“and key to keeping it cool are the mass
ive rainforests of the Amazon. Sadly, weâ€™ve had a hard time not cutting them d
own. 
  
 A new project should help preventâ€“or at least slow downâ€“that hot future. If
 all goes to plan over the next six years, a project led by Conservation Interna
tional will become the largest tropical reforestation project in history. Sevent
y-three million trees will sprout up across whatâ€™s known as the â€œarc of defo
restation,â€ in the Brazilian states of Amazonas, Acre, ParÃ¡, RondÃ´nia, and t
hroughout the Xingu watershed. The short-term plan is to restore 70,000 acres (t
he area of 30,000 soccer fields) that have been cleared for pastureland to their
 former forested glory. 
  
  
  
 â€œIf the world is to hit the 1.2Â°C or 2Â°C [degrees of warming] target that w
e all agreed to in Paris, then protecting tropical forests in particular has to 
be a big part of that,â€ M. Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International, tells 
Fast Company. â€œItâ€™s not just the trees that matter, but what kind of trees. 
If youâ€™re really thinking about getting carbon dioxide out of atmosphere, then
 tropical forests are the ones that end up mattering the most.â€ 
  
 Heâ€™s right: Simply stopping deforestation could allow existing forests to abs
orb up to 37% of our annual carbon emissions; replenishing degraded areas could 
do significantly more for the planet. 
  
 â€œThis is not a stunt,â€ Sanjayan says. â€œIt is a carefully controlled exper
iment to literally figure out how to do tropical restoration at scale, so that p
eople can replicate it and we can drive the costs down dramatically.â€ 
  
 Over the past 40 years, about 20% of the Amazon has been cut down or destroyed,
 and scientists worry that another 20% of the rainforest will be lost in the nex
t couple of decades. So, instead of following precedent and planting saplings, w
hich are labor and resource intensive to manage (and, depending on the selected 
species, may not be best-suited for the territory, resulting in less than ideal 
survival rates), the organizing coalition is trying something different. 
  
  
  
 Developed in Brazil only a few years ago, the new planting technique is called 
muvuca. â€œIn Portuguese, it means a lot of people in a very small place,â€ say
s Rodrigo Medeiros, Conservation Internationalâ€™s vice president of the Brazil 
program and the lead on the ground. 
  
  ||||| Assuming everything goes to plan, over the next six years, the Amazon ra
inforest will get 73 million new trees. The mass planting is part of a project s
ponsored by Conservation International, the Brazilian Ministry of Environment, a
nd a number of other NGOs and corporations. As John Converse Townsend at Fast Co
mpany reports, it is the largest tropical reforestation effort ever attempted. 
  
 According to a press release from Conservation International, the effort will s
pan deforested pasture lands over a 74,000-acre region spanning several Brazilia
n statesâ€”with the greatest focus in Southern Amazonas, RondÃ´nia, Acre, ParÃ¡ 
and the Xingu watershed. The purpose of the project is, in part, to revive the 2
0 percent of the Amazon that has been lost to deforestation due to agriculture a
nd pasturing during the last 40 years. But the effort is also geared toward lear
ning how to restore tropical forests. 
  
 â€œThis is a breathtakingly audacious project,â€ says M. Sanjayan, CEO of Cons
ervation International, according to the release. â€œThe fate of the Amazon depe
nds on getting this rightâ€”as do the regionâ€™s 25 million residents, its count
less species and the climate of our planet.â€ 
  
 As Townsend reports, reforestation efforts are typically very costly and time c
onsumingâ€”requiring people to both grow and plant thousands of saplings, many o
f which will not survive. In this latest effort, the restorationists are trying 
a new method called muvuca, in which they will spread the seeds of native trees 
across the slash and burned land and animal pastures. The seeds come from the Xi
ngu Seed Network, which uses a coalition of 400 collectors to gather the seeds f
rom native trees. 
  
 â€œWith plant-by-plant reforestation techniques, you get a typical density of a
bout 160 plants per hectare,â€ Rodrigo Medeiros, vice president of Conservation
 Internationalâ€™s Brazil program, tells Townsend. â€œWith muvuca, the initial o
utcome is 2,500 [trees] per hectare. And after 10 years, you can reach 5,000 tre
es per hectare. Itâ€™s much more diverse, much more dense, and less expensive th
an traditional techniques.â€ 
  
 The muvuca experiment is the beginning of a massive effort announced by Brazil 
to restore 12 million hectares of forest, an area the size of Pennsylvania, as p
art of an effort to reach their climate change goals under the Paris Accord. Rec
ent studies show that second growth forestsâ€”those less than 60 years old that 
grow after logging or land clearanceâ€”can sequester huge amounts of carbon. As 
Townsend reports, just stopping current deforestation could help mitigate 37 per
cent of current carbon emissions. Planting or restoring forests could make that 
number even bigger. 
  
 While the effort is impressive, itâ€™s not the largest reforestation effort in 
the world. In July, 2016, 800,000 people in Uttar Pradesh, India, planted 50 mil
lion trees in just 24 hours, a publicity stunt to highlight Indiaâ€™s Paris Acco
rd commitment to reforest 12 percent of its land by 2030. The worldâ€™s largest 
program, however, is Chinaâ€™s Grain-for-Green effort, a plan to restore 69.2 mi
llion acres of forest land, which is an area the size of New York and Pennsylvan
ia combined. 
  
 All of these efforts are encouraging, but replanting is only half of the soluti
on. Twenty-five million acres of forests are cleared each year, writes Doug Bouc
her, Director of Climate Research and Analysis at the Union of Concerned Scienti
sts. He points out that while the long-term benefits of reforestation are helpfu
l for the climate, the decades it takes for forests to regrow means it will take
 a while to see benefits. This means other more immediate solutions, such as red
ucing industrial emissions and halting the removal of forests, are still necessa
ry to make a dent in our changing climate. |||||
