A community stalwart with an MBE has been spared jail after claiming more than Â
£23,000 of taxpayers' money by lying about his savings. Former magistrate Rahmat
 Ali Raja, 75, dishonestly claimed pension credits and council tax reductions fo
r 10 years - despite, at one point, having more than Â£102,000 across nine bank 
accounts. But the retired charity director, who was also a local councillor in P
endle, Lancashire, was yesterday spared jail for his crimes. Guilty: Rahmat Ali 
Raja, 75, was yesterday spared jail for falsely claiming more than Â£23,000 in b
enefits. The former magistrate and local councillor was awarded an MBE in 2005 .
 Speaking after the hearing, Raja, originally from Gujarat, Pakistan, said: 'I a
m very sorry. I made a mistake.' Raja, who has already paid the amounts . back i
n full, was handed a 24-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months. He pleade
d guilty to two counts of dishonestly failing to . disclose information to make 
a gain for self, and one count of . dishonestly making a false statement to obta
in a benefit. Preston Magistrates' Court heard that, between October 2003 and Se
ptember 2013, Raja told the Department for Work and Pensions he was retired and 
had just Â£5,601 in savings. He wrongly claimed Â£11,379 in the process. Dishone
st: The retired charity director received pension credits and council tax reduct
ions for 10 years . Raja also failed to declare his real savings to Pendle Counc
il in November 2004, allowing him to wrongly claim Â£11,898 between October 2003
 and March 2013. John Abbott, prosecuting, told the court how Raja would receive
 the payments into his Halifax bank account via automatic credit transfer. He sa
id: 'Evidence has now become available that he had Â£83,000 on October 6, 2003 w
hich was not disclosed at the time. Had the true facts been known, there would h
ave been an effect on his benefits.' In 2009, Raja claimed he only had one bank 
account, which he shared with his wife. But Mr Abbott said: 'He had nine other a
ccounts in his and his wifeâ€™s names and agrees they were there when he made th
e original claims for pension credit. He denied acting dishonestly and said he m
ade a mistake.' John Wishart, defending, said: 'First of all, the guidelines mak
e it clear that a large sum of money can be accumulated over a long period of ti
me, as in this case. 'Of considerable mitigation is that the money was instantly
 repaid in full. The final payment was made in September last year.' He added th
at the â€˜highest recorded amountâ€™ in Rajaâ€™s savings at any one time was â€˜
a little over Â£102,000â€™. He added that although these accounts were in his na
me, they were shared by many members of Rajaâ€™s family. Sparing Raja jail, chai
rman of the bench Kathleen Strickland said his offences had been aggravated beca
use he 'committed the fraud from the outsetâ€™. But she said Rajaâ€™s age, early
 guilty plea, full repayment and ill health prevented her from handing out an im
mediate custodial sentence. As well as his suspended jail sentence, which could 
be activated it he re-offends within 12 months, Raja must pay court costs of Â£8
5 and a Â£75 victim surcharge. Mrs Strickland said: â€œIf you break this conditi
on it could be very serious for you.â€ Spared jail: Raja, the former director o
f a community development trust, was handed a 24-week prison sentence, suspended
 for 12 months, at Preston Magistrates' Court . Raja was chosen to receive an MB
E through his work as a former director of the Ithaad Community Development Trus
t in Nelson, which provided help and advice to those who needed it. Speaking aft
er the case, he said: â€œI am very sorry. I made a mistake. All along I have sai
d itâ€™s my familyâ€™s money and my childrenâ€™s money. â€œI filled out the form
s but I did them wrong. My memory is not good and I am sorry.â€
