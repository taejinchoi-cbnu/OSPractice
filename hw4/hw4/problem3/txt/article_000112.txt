Herbrert used the foul slur while criticising the response to Home Secretary The
resa May's attack on the way ordinary police officers treated the public. Mrs Ma
y had accused PCs of treating the public with 'contempt' and threatened to overh
aul the way they ran themselves if they did not sort themselves out. Her controv
ersial speech to the Police Federation conference in Bournemouth yesterday spark

 Daily Politics TV show. Presenter Jo Coburn was forced to apologise for his beh
aviour and warn him not to repeat the slur. Mr Herbert MP was defending Theresa 
May's  speech to the Police Federation conference in Bournemouth when he quoted 
a vile attack on the Home Secretary by a senior former detective . After using t
he word  on the BBC's live Daily Politics programme, hosted by Andrew Neil,Â Mr 
Herbert was inundated with complaints and the BBC was forced to apologised for t
he remark. The Conservative MPÂ was criticising some police officersâ€™ 'infanti
le' response to the Home Secretary's speech yesterday.. He said: 'I am afraid th
ere have been a minority who have been outspoken and they are very active on twi
tter and I saw Peter [Kirkham â€“ former detective chief inspector] himself yest
erday described the Home Secretary as a â€˜f*ckwitâ€™ in his own twitter line. '
Indeed we should not have any more of it from either police officers or former p
olice officers - this kind of infantile discussion that goes on. What we need is
 a serious discussion about how policing has got to adapt to todayâ€™s age and t
he things that need to be done to sort out the problems that we have seen.' He l
ater defended his actions and pointed out that he used the term 'disapprovingly'
. But presenter Jo Coburn interrupted Mr Herbert, telling him 'we won't have any
 more of that' and cautioning him to speak 'without repeating any of those exple
tives'. Mr Herbert responded: 'Indeed we should not have any more of it, from ei
ther police officers or former police officers, this kind of infantile discussio
n that goes on.' The Home Secretary launched a furious assault on the police yes
terday - accusing them of treating the public with 'contempt' At the end of the 
programme Ms Coburn offered a full apology for the outburst, saying it was unacc
eptable and would not be repeated. Explaining his actions on Twitter following t
he broadcast, Mr Herbert said: 'Shame on the former police officer on the prog w
ho used the word to describe the Home Sec and who I was quoting disapprovingly.'
 A BBC spokeswoman said: 'Daily Politics is a live programme and, as with any li
ve broadcast, occasionally slip-ups may happen. We apologised to viewers immedia
tely for any offence caused.' A number of people expressed their disapproval on 
Twitter that such language was used on a daytime political discussion. Mr Kirkha
m later appeared to dispute having used the term, posting a message which said: 
'Genuinely don't recall doing so 'a couple of days ago'!' Labour MP Liz Kendall 
was among those to condemn the bad language, saying on Twitter: 'My dad is const
ituent of Nick Herbert. Very unhappy at reports of his comments on Daily Politic
s. Completely inappropriate, especially for an MP.' Greater Manchester Chief Con
stable Sir Peter Fahy pleader for a truce in the war of words between Theresa Ma
y and the police . Mr Herbert was attacking the Police Federation's response to 
Mrs May's brutal assault on their record. He said the organisation, which repres
ents rank and file officers, had been a 'terrible advert' for British policing a
nd welcomed, what he described as, their reluctant acceptance of the changes pro
posed at conference. 'I think there is this continuing problem that there is an 
element within the Police Federation that hasnâ€™t understood the importance of 
policing needing to change and the Federation itself needing to change. 'The Fed
eration has been a terrible advert for policing; the behaviour of its members du
ring the conferences, which has been often boorish even drunken; the way in whic
h they refuse to embrace any kind of discussion about the police service, has to
 do with a lot of the problems that it has confronted. 'There have been string o
f problems and they have got to be addressed. The Home Secretary listed all of t
hose. Itâ€™s not representative, itâ€™s not diverse, there are very few women th
ere, there are certainly almost no black and minority ethnic police officers the
re. Itâ€™s a really bad advert for British policing and it has to change and itâ
€™s not just me saying that. 'There has been this report, led by David Normingto
n commissioned by the federation itself that listed all the ways in which the Fe
deration was not fit for purpose and needed to change and pointed out that it do
es not enjoy the confidence of the overwhelming majority of its own members. 'I 
am very pleased that finally the Federation did, yesterday, vote for change. It 
was opposed by the Metropolitan Police Federation, which was a quarter of all po
licing. So I am afraid there are elements which donâ€™t understand, that live in
 this Jurassic Park world of policing in a different age and Iâ€™m afraid itâ€™s
 got to change.'
