:16 EST, 6 January 2014 . Doctors are concerned that data harvested from patient
s by the Government will fall into the hands of hackers or be sold to insurers a
nd drugs firms for use in targeting patients . Doctors are rebelling against pla
ns to harvest personal information from the medical files of millions of patient
s. From spring, officials will begin building a giant database they say will hel
p them identify poor performance such as long waiting times and late diagnosis o
f diseases such as cancer. They believe the information might even lead to new t
reatments. But there is widespread concern among MPs, academics and doctors that
 the data will fall into the hands of hackers or be sold to insurers and drugs f
irms for use in targeting patients. NHS England, which is overseeing the scheme,
 says privacy will be ensured because only dates of birth, postcodes and NHS num
bers will be stored. But each year more than a million medical files go missing 
from the Health Service â€“ many of them lost on public transport or dumped in b
ins. Unless patients tell their GP in person or over the phone that they do not 
want to be involved in the scheme, their data will be harvested automatically. C
ritics say the NHS is making it deliberately difficult for patients to opt out â
€“ given how hard it is to make an appointment with a doctor or even speak to th
em on the phone. At least two GPs are so opposed to the scheme they have removed
 the thousands of patients on their books from it unless they have specifically 
asked to be included. One of the doctors, who is based in Oxford and is remainin
g anonymous for fear of reprisals, said he believed the scheme breached data pro
tection laws. Starting today, the NHS will begin dropping leaflets through the d
oors of all households explaining the scheme. It is not clear whether patients w
ill have to see their GP in person or call the surgery - it will vary between pr
actices. There is also concern most of the public will never read them because t
hey will be lost among junk mail. David Davis, a Tory MP and former shadow home 
secretary, said: 'It's an enormous threat to privacy. To make patients go in and
 makeÂ  an appointment with their GP isÂ  frankly disgraceful. 'The database doe
s have huge value for the NHS but it will go wrong. Some people's information wi
ll be lost. If hackers can take on Microsoft, how long until they get to the Dep
artment of Health?' Sarah Wollaston, a Tory MP and GP who sits on the Commons He
alth Select Committee, said: There's no doubt that sharing records is good for p
atient care. But ultimately patients own their medical records and they should d
ecide who they share them with. Tory MP and former shadow home secretary David D
avis said: 'It's an enormous threat to privacy.' 'There are some people who migh
t want to access it, not for the best reasons, for example insurance companies.'
 There is concern that officials will use the data to make cuts to NHS services 
where they aren't deemed to be needed â€“ such as diabetes clinics in areas wher
e the disease is less common. Campaigners say drug firms could even use the data
 to raise premiums for at-risk groups. Ross Anderson, who specialises in informa
tion security at Cambridge University, accused Health Service officials of delib
erate deception. He said: 'The NHS takes the view that it's our information, we'
ll do with it what we want. There is no effort to maintain patients' privacy.' T
he professor said it would be very easy for researchers, drugs firms or insurers
 to identify patients just by knowing their postcode and date of birth alone. Ul
timately, he said it could lead to highly personal information about patients' i
llnesses or conditions appearing on the internet or in research papers. Phil Boo
th, of the campaign group Med Confidential, said the scheme was cynical and irre
sponsible. But Dr Geraint Lewis, who is chief data officer at NHS England, said:
 'The NHS has been collecting information like this from hospitals for decades b
ut until now we've been missing information about the quality of care provided o
utside hospital. 'This is about upgrading our information systems to get a more 
complete picture of the quality of care being delivered across all parts of the 
NHS and social care.' Dr Martin Scurr warned the database will 'be a honeypot fo
r hackers' Ever since the launch of the NHS in 1948, patients have been able to 
rely on a principle of confidentiality â€“ they have always been assured that th
eir medical notesÂ  are private. But now, for the first time, we GPs are being t
old to pass those notes to a third party. The records will be mined for data by 
the Health and Social Care Information Centre, but in future that could be passe
d on to researchers and even drugs firms with commercial profits in mind. We are
 told that all personal data will be in an â€˜anonymous' form. But it will inclu
de your postcode and your NHS number. Hardly very anonymous, then. You can't tel
l me that this is not a breach of confidentiality. If the situation was differen
t and a GP handed over this kind of information to a third party, and the patien
t found out and complained, the consequences would be severe. That complaint wou
ld be taken to the General Medical Council, and the first thing it would do woul
d be to suspend the GP pending an investigation for a breach of professional eth
ics. Yet apparently it's quite all right for a government body to do this. This 
is really important and the public need to know about it. From today NHS England
 â€“ which runs the health service â€“ begins posting leaflets through doors exp
laining how and why this data is being used. Leaflets are all well and good, but
 what will people do with those leaflets? Some will simply bin them, mistaking t
hem for junk mail. Doubtless there will be patients who wouldn't want their data
 releasedÂ  but simply won't know that it is happening. If you tell your GP that
 you want to opt out, your details will not be released. But why should the Gove
rnment decide to release this private information unless you actively take steps
 to stop it? Surely it should be the other way round â€“ that people should opt 
in. To say that this is the thin end of the wedge is an understatement. Who's to
 say that confidential information you give to your GP might not be used against
 you in terms of health insurance? As David Davis MP rightly says, it will also 
be a honeypot for hackers. There may be benefits that come from researchers bein
g able to look at this data, but we have no reason to trust the Government on th
is. After all, it has a particularly poor reputation when it comes to dealing wi
th IT systems, and it is perfectly possible this data could be abused â€“ at cat
aclysmic cost to the patient.
