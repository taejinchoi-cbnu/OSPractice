It will cost Crystal Palace £10million for them to convert Wilfried Zaha's loan
 switch from Manchester United into a permanent one. The 22-year-old left Selhur
st Park in January 2013 but has returned to his former club on loan after failin
g to make an impression under both David Moyes and Louis van Gaal at United. The
 Eagles are reportedly working on a transfer window deal  that would see them pa
y a flat £3million fee, plus £3m in add-ons to United if the triggers are met 
- and the loss of £4m in add-ons written off in the original deal which saw Zah
a leave for Old Trafford. Crystal Palace are interested in bringing Wilfried Zah
a (left) back to Selhurst Park . The former Eagles winger could cost the club £
10m in making his loan deal permanent . Although Zaha's move to Manchester Unite
d was valued at £15m, his failure to reach add-on targets meant the Red Devils 
should recoup their outlay after paying a down payment of £10m and wages of £3
5,000-per-week. After being largely overlooked by previous manager Neil Warnock,
 Zaha has been given a new lease of life under Alan Pardew  who has used him in
 all four matches he has taken charge of following his own return. 'I have a smi
le on my face because I am back on the pitch,' Zaha said. Zaha failed to make an
 impression following his £15m move to Manchester United in January 2013 . Alan
 Pardew's arrival as manager has given Zaha a new lease of life at Crystal Palac
e . 'There was a period where I thought: 'What is going on here?' But I said to 
myself that if I got minutes on the pitch I would get better and better. 'The ga
ffer has put his trust in me and I am trying to give it back and perform for the
 team. When I am here, I feel more confident. I have lived in south London all m
y life and my family is here. 'I cannot keep that in my head all the time becaus
e I could have another move, but Crystal Palace is my home.'
