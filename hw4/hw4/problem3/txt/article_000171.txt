At a prep school in Kent, during High Tea, a master asks his pupils if anyone wo
uld like to do ballet. In a sea of waving girlsâ€™ paws, only one little boyâ€™s
 hand shoots up. Mine. And then, with howl of the other childrenâ€™s laughter ec
hoing in my ears, I realised: boys donâ€™t do ballet. So I bottled out, and I ha
ve always regretted it. Called to the Barre: Richard Dennen is put through his p
aces in his BarreCorre class by owner Niki Rein . Today, male ballet dancers are
 the new rock stars. The Adonis-like Brazilian Carlos Acosta is a household name
 and Sergei Polunin, a 23-year-old tattooed Russian wild child, made headlines w
hen he sensationally quit as principal of the Royal Ballet last year. Now, appar
ently, rock stars are doing ballet. Mick Jagger, a sprightly 69 and preparing to
 headline the Glastonbury Festival with The Rolling Stones next weekend, has rev
ealed how he credited his remarkable fitness to ballet. Then I heard about the b
allet-based workout class at Barrecore studio on Kings Road, Chelsea, run by fit
ness guru Niki Rein. She is rumoured to be behind Princess Beatriceâ€™s new figu
re and I was intrigued to find out what you have to go through to get a ballet b
ody... NOT JUST FOR GIRLS . The . class is actually a hybrid of Pilates and ball
et, incorporating cardio, . light weights and various stretching and balancing p
oses, all to music. Moves like me: Mick Jagger, 69, takes regular ballet classes
 to keep physically fit . Itâ€™s most certainly not just for girls. â€˜Half of t
he guys who come canâ€™t finish their first class,â€™ says Niki. â€˜We work on l
egs and the lower half of the body, which men arenâ€™t used to. 'Men are stronge
r in the upper body so they power through press-ups. But then they stand at the 
barre and after the first set of thighs their legs are all over the place, the e
yes glaze over .â€‰â€‰.â€‰â€‰. they start to get dizzy.â€™ I thought I was going
 to die after my first class, but I could quickly see why itâ€™s becoming a cult
 hit. A number of gyms have started offering ballet-style workouts, and Britainâ
€™s biggest, Virgin Active, is looking at rolling it out nationwide. There is ge
nuine sports science behind it. Gillian Reeves, national group exercise manager 
for Virgin Active, explains: â€˜Ballet improves posture, balance and co-ordinati
on. 'The exercises all promote muscular strength and endurance but wonâ€™t bulk 
the body, helping to give that lean, dancer physique. For the greatest benefits,
 a healthy diet is needed also.â€™ A PERKIER BOTTOM . Niki promises longer, lean
er limbs and the pert bottom of a dancer. â€˜Ballet makes you leaner, and stand 
taller. 'There is a focus on the back of the body and if the back is strong, the
n it makes the shoulders look broader, you carry yourself taller, and the waist 
looks smaller.â€™ Niki arrived in London in 2009 after working with dance-cardio
 celebrity trainer Tracey Anderson and celebrities including Madonna and Gwyneth
 Paltrow. She started a private barre class in a clientâ€™s mews house and, when
 25 ladies turned up, quickly realised that London needed her. THIGHS FEEL THE B
URN . The class, for normally no more than ten to 15 people, lasts an hour and t
akes place in a dance studio with a mirrored wall and a long rail â€“ the barre 
â€“ that runs the length of the room, just above my waist height. Ideal Adonis: 
Ballet rockstar Carlos Acosta is an fitness inspiration for men across the globe
 . After a warm-up, there are press-ups and planks (where you hold the extended 
press-up position until your middle is shaking with the strain) .â€‰â€‰.â€‰â€‰. 
and then the real workout starts. There are various ballet-inspired positions: h
olding a ball between your thighs, you stand on tiptoe and pulse up and down. In
 another you lean forward with your head on the bar, wiggling your leg while itâ
€™s extended behind you. My thighs burn, my legs tremble. Later, I am so stiff a
nd sore I think I might have done permanent damage. IT WORKS... BUT IT HURTS . A
fter a month of going once a week, I am gradually getting more flexible. Like mo
st men, I have very tight hamstrings. But now my standing splits â€“ where you b
end forward, hands flat on the floor, while you try to extend one leg back and p
oint to the ceiling â€“ are getting a bit better. Weâ€™re told that 15 minutes o
f ballet can burn up to 100 calories, and my body has changed. I am slimmer: if 
anything, I look at bit too skinny. But the gender divide remains: in a month I 
only saw one other man in the class. I think that boys are scared of ballet. You
 have to swallow your pride, as I did, collapsing on the mat while the woman nex
t to me did 15 push-ups with her leg in the air. To anyone who is man enough to 
try it, I can confirm it works. But God, it hurts. Hour-long classes start from
