Tony Adams wants the current Arsenal squad to stop calling him â€˜Mr Adamsâ€™. H
e wants to stop having to tell them how it feels to be a winner because none of 
them know. He wants them to start writing their own history, starting with lifti
ng the FA Cup at Wembley. It feels fitting that Adams is speaking at Repton Boxi
ng Club in east London, in front of a black and white poster screaming â€˜No Gut
s No Gloryâ€™. He is incredulous that Arsenal could be stifled by the tag of fav
ourites and seems equally unimpressed as he explains Arsene Wenger believes he h
as a squad capable of winning the Champions League. Mr Arsenal: Tony Adams (left
) won plenty of trophies as Arsenal skipper including the 1989 league title . Te
ar it down: Adams has been honoured with a statue, but wants this generation to 
write a new history . But then Adams, as he puts it, â€˜likes winning thingsâ€™.
 The former Arsenal captain can look back on four League titles, three FA Cups a
nd two League Cups between 1987 and 2002. If his old club secure fourth place in
 the Barclays Premier League and the FA Cup this season it would only mean the c
ampaign has â€˜not been a failure; not like having to play in the Europa League 
like Tottenhamâ€™. He adds: â€˜None of this Arsenal team knows what itâ€™s like 
to win a trophy for the club. Arsene remembers, but not these players. â€˜I did 
a Q&A with some of the players the other week, and all the questions about winni
ng were coming to me because they didnâ€™t have the answers. â€˜I was talking to
 Carl Jenkinson and Kieran Gibbs and I was telling them: â€œYou need to know how
 it feels just to get over the lineâ€ because itâ€™s a weird feeling. â€˜It was
 normal for us to win games. Iâ€™m not so sure this group of players has that. â
€˜They call me Mr Adams and stuff! Iâ€™m not sure I ever called older players â€
œMisterâ€. Ambition: Wenger badly wants to win the Champions League after comin
g so close in 2006, says Adams . Learning to win: Adams has had to answer questi
ons about success to both GIbbs (left) and Jenkinson (right) â€˜I want them to b
e pushing me to the side and ripping my statue down and make their own history. 
â€˜Theyâ€™re lovely guys, but they need leadership. Mikel Artetaâ€™s a good pro 
without being, for me, a great player, but he will say â€œcome onâ€. â€˜(Per) M
ertesackerâ€™s been more verbal this year. I had a go at Per at the beginning of
 the season and said: â€œYou donâ€™t have to be Mr Nice Guy, you donâ€™t have to
 be liked.â€ You donâ€™t just go through your career letting it go by and missi
ng the moment.â€™ Adams believes Wenger had â€˜10 easy yearsâ€™ in his first dec
ade at Arsenal, having inherited that famous back five and an â€˜unbelievable sq
uadâ€™ of players â€˜ready to be taughtâ€™. The 47-year-old thinks the Frenchman
 should sign a new contract at the club, regardless of the outcome at Wembley, b
ut disagrees with Wengerâ€™s optimism about the potential of his squad to win Eu
ropeâ€™s most glittering prize. Leaders: Both Arteta (left) and Mertesacker (rig
ht) have had to learn to be more assertive this season . â€˜I think Arsene reall
y wants to win the Champions League,â€™ says Adams, â€˜and I think he still thin
ks this group of players can do it for him. While heâ€™s still got that belief, 
heâ€™ll stick around. â€˜If he thought that this squad couldnâ€™t win him the Ch
ampions League I think heâ€™d move on to Barcelona or a club that would deliver 
that for him before he goes to Paris Saint-Germain. â€˜Do I share that optimism?
 No, I donâ€™t. I donâ€™t think the full backs are good enough. Theyâ€™ve really
 struggled this year. â€˜But I think Arsene should stay. I think, financially, h
e does fantastic for the club and thereâ€™s a great structure in place and bette
r the devil you know. â€˜He came in to take over an unbelievable squad, with an 
untapped French market, and he found a captain who had sobered up six weeks ago 
and was ready to grab life, instead of grabbing a pint, so a lot of his circumst
ances are to do with timing. â€˜When the teacher appeared, that team was ready t
o run. I think he had 10 easy years, really.â€™ In conjunction with The European
 Azerbaijan Society and to mark World Refugee Week, Tony Adams is promoting a ga
la charity boxing night at York Hall, East London, on Friday 27th June. Tickets 
are available at www.Repton-Gabala.eventbrite.co.uk and proceeds will go to the 
Mo Farah Foundation.
