About 30 people had been living in tents on St Peter's Square, outside the Centr
al Library, since 15 April.
Manchester City Council had been issued a warrant to close the camp, with campai
gners losing an appeal.
The demonstrators have now set up another settlement about half a mile away, in 
St Anne's Square.
Police and bailiffs arrived at about 08:00 BST to break up the St Peter's Square
 camp.
Some protesters packed up their tents and equipment and left the area peacefully
, but others resisted.
Campaigners said they wanted to highlight a crisis in temporary housing and the 
plight of homeless people.
The council said some demonstrators had been behaving "entirely inappropriately"
 in a public area.
Deputy Leader of Manchester City Council Bernard Priest said: "While it is entir
ely legitimate to raise concerns about homelessness, there have been issues with
 offensive graffiti and other forms of vandalism, fighting, public urination, st
reet drinking, litter and loud music being played.
"The camp has now cost the council and Greater Manchester Police more than Â£8
8,000 in additional policing, security and legal costs. In the current climate, 
this is not an extra cost any public body can shoulder lightly.
"Over the last month, our homelessness service has provided support and advice t
o more than 20 members of the camp - as they work regularly with other homeless 
people across the city - and officers were present prior to and during the evict
ion to provide accommodation to anyone willing to accept it."
