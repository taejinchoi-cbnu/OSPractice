The glitch caused iPad software - used by the planes' pilots and co-pilots for v
iewing flight plans - to stop working.
The firm's cockpits went "paperless" in 2013 to save its staff having to lug hea
vy paperwork on board. AA estimated the move would save it more than $1.2m (Â£
793,600) in fuel every year.
The company said that it was still investigating the cause of the problem.
"Some American Airlines flights experienced an issue with a software application
 on pilot iPads yesterday evening," a spokesman told the BBC.
"In some cases, the flight had to return to the gate to access a wi-fi connectio
n to fix the issue.
"We apologise for the inconvenience to our customers and we had them on the way 
to their destinations soon afterwards."
Serge Gojkovich, chief executive of car parking app-maker Curbstand, was among t
he passengers affected.
He tweeted that his San Francisco-to-Los Angeles flight was only able to get air
borne after the crew had printed off the maps they needed.
A spokesman for the airline was unable to confirm the report.
American Airlines is not the only carrier whose pilots and cabin crew have switc
hed from using physical charts and paper manuals to tablets.
United Airlines was also an early adopter of iPads, while Delta has opted for Mi
crosoft's Surface tablets instead.
British Airways and Ryanair are among others still in the process of shifting to
 so-called Electronic Flight Bag-based systems.
In addition to saving on fuel costs, it is also suggested that such kit reduces 
flight preparation time, reduces the likelihood of injuries and helps staff by o
ffering real-time updates.
There is competition between several firms to provide the software and support t
hat make the technology possible.
American Airlines pilots use an app called FliteDeck, which is made by the Boein
g subsidiary Jeppesen.
A spokeswoman for the firm was unable to provide comment when contacted by the B
BC.
