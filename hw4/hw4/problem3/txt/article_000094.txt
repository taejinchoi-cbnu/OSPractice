Justin Welby made the announcement after a meeting of primates from the Anglican
 Communion in Canterbury.
In the UK, an act of Parliament passed in 1928 allowed for Easter Sunday to be f
ixed on the first Sunday after the second Saturday in April.
However, this has never been activated and Easter has remained variable, determi
ned by the moon's cycle.
Easter is the most important Christian festival, as it celebrates the resurrecti
on of Jesus Christ following his death by crucifixion on Good Friday.
The archbishop said he was in talks with Pope Francis, Coptic leader Pope Tawadr
os, and the leader of the Orthodox church Patriarch Bartholomew.
Mr Welby said he hoped the change would happen "in between five and 10 years tim
e".
"I would love to see it before I retired", he said, although he warned the first
 attempt to make such a change was in the 10th Century.
An Anglican source told the BBC there had been 15 attempts to agree a common dat
e since then.
Easter is on the first Sunday after the first ecclesiastical full moon following
 the spring equinox, meaning it can be celebrated on a Sunday between 22 March a
nd 25 April.
But the Orthodox church follows the Julian calendar, hence has later Easter cele
brations compared with those of Western Christianity.
In 1990, the Vatican approved a proposal for a fixed date, which was subject to 
agreement with other Christian churches and governments. It has not yet been rea
ched.
