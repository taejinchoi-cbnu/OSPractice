"This course aims to offer comprehensive background on Operating Systems to undergrad students majoring in Computer Science.
Following the textbook structure, we will explore three major components of operating systems--Process, Memory Systems and File Systems--to understand the fundamental concepts and design principles. 
In alignment with the lectures, students will receive programming assignments to master their understanding of the concepts that they have learned in the lectures.
